Transcript:

(00:00) hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse this is NFA live we do this every single Friday or sorry every single Thursday I should say um and we have Rob and guy back with us again how are you guys doing today good Ben how you doing pretty good how about you guy yeah I'm well thanks Ben I'm will it's a pleasure to have you guys here again um we'll talk a little bit about everything sort of going on right now so the first thing that I mean just to give you guys a brief summary of what we're

(00:37) going to talk about today we're going to first start talk about the US government um selling the Bitcoin right seems to be a recurring headline sometimes it's fake sometimes it's real uh and then we're gonna talk about the whole crypto Bros video by the politician talking about printing printing Fiat out of thin air um and then we'll talk a little bit about CPI and then we'll talk about some of the new you know I had dealing with the fomo and whatnot and then also I'm curious you know what you guys would be

(01:03) doing if if it weren't for this uh but let's go ahead and get started um Rob we'll start with you first on this one um the the US government I mean it just seems like it seems like there's some new headline every every other week where you know there's the US government's selling their Bitcoin and of course they actually did sell some a couple of months ago but ever since then people keep wondering like is every move down is that the US government selling and there's like these headlines sort of

(01:31) make the make the rounds what's your view on this I mean is this something that the market can absorb you know pretty easily the last time it seemed to absorb it or do you think that this is going to pose some issues for Bitcoin this year thing about on-chain metrics and we talked about this a long time ago uh it was Canon chain metrics be be manipulated because everybody thinks that once something transfers once you have a Bitcoin wallet go another Bitcoin wallet someone sold something that's not the case it just means they move

(02:06) something and that means like I mean if you're like a whale manipulator you might move it from your your one wallet with uh you know 400 Bitcoin to your other wallet with 1600 Bitcoin or whatever whatever it is so it doesn't really mean that that is actually the case however having said that we know so far with some data the US government has roughly 205 000 Bitcoins and people look at that and go well it's you know is that a lot that's a boatload and it's a it's a ton like just for for

(02:39) reference microstrategy and this may be numbers be all there's a there's a great website called Bitcoin worldwide.com and microstrategy has 140 000 Bitcoin Galaxy digital has 40 000. and if you look at uh some of the ones that that everybody gets scared sless about when they hear this term Mount gox is selling you know how many Bitcoin that mount gox has right now they have 141 000.

(03:08)  so if the US government just decides you know what man we need some liquidity and it's time because we keep printing out a thin air like that genius who who talked about it a little bit ago uh which we're gonna get into a second if they need some liquidity guess what's getting sold the thing that the U.S government more specifically the bite Administration does not want a part of and that is cryptum digital assets so if they want I got to tell you something now I think about it this could be a great play if they wanted just to crash

(03:35) the market go let's just get rid of this trash we want to be the US dollar Reserve currency let's just sell it all let's just sell it all and let these crypto Bros just sit down and squalor and they could do that and it would be a pretty possibly let's be honest be a pretty good play for them and then everybody would go down you know would be great for people like us and the people that you at home watching this video it's probably great for us because we're like thank you because we know in the long

(04:01) run in two to five years it's gonna be fantastic you just gave me the greatest opportunity I'm going to have in quite some time not Financial advice NFA but uh that that's how I see things and uh we'll see how it goes I'm actually I'm kind of hoping they do but that's just kind of greedy I mean sorry okay if they uh maybe if they sell it all it'll extend uh it'll delay the debt ceiling by an hour or something bad ceiling yeah good point good point right hour you know maybe about an hour

(04:31) or so it gives a little bit more time to negotiate guy what are your thoughts um on on the US government selling Bitcoin I mean like is this just something that it's gonna make the headlines for the next year do you know Ben Mike the first thing I thought when I saw because I I I was looking up to see how much they had and yeah as as Rob says they've got sort of over 200k um uh Bitcoins just sitting there and I saw an estimate that said well if they were to sell it all at once it would probably take the price down to around

(05:03) 10K yeah and I thought to myself I know someone who'd be absolutely delighted about that um and uh so it doesn't surprise me to hear Rob uh Rob say and I must say like I'm I'm kind of with you rob like it would be it would be pretty it would be pretty painful but it would be an enormous opportunity um and I think people would there would be plenty of people uh absolutely desperate to Hoover it up at that price at around 10K if they did do that however I I don't think I mean yeah it's it's an

(05:37) interesting situation isn't it because here's this here's this entity that is sort of manifestly against crypto and they've kind of you know they've kind of got this this nuclear weapon up there sleeve as it were um I I can't see them I mean yeah as you say there's there's these rumors there was a rumor a couple of weeks ago that they were selling wasn't it was it the US government and mount gox was supposed to be selling a couple of weeks ago and the market got a bit spooked then

(06:05) um yeah and then yesterday yeah it was they were supposedly selling around sort of just just shy of 10K Bitcoin or something so I mean even yeah even just seeing it move even just the rumor of it's enough to uh to tank the market well tank the market a little bit I mean I think it made up it made up a lot of those losses sort of fairly quickly um so I mean yeah I I must say I don't see them going about it that way I kind of think if they if they were looking to sell they would probably they would probably do it a bit more strategically

(06:40) I I think they'd look to because you know if you hold an asset as you say the US government it needs money it's got It's got this debt ceiling issue um so yeah I think they would probably look not too not to sort of cause chaos in the market I I kind of feel even even though they don't like crypto I wonder how willing they would be to sort of cause Carnage in any particular market right now so I think it would probably be sold fairly strategically and perhaps they'd sort of try and sell it a bit

(07:11) closer to the top because I think they uh I think they're getting a reputation now for I mean they've they've taken a huge amount of losses they've sold the fair bit already haven't they and they've well below uh the sort of prices they could get for it so um yeah they're going I have to answer to the to the taxpayer for that one um and I do Wonder as well you know if they were to sell let's say they were to sell strategically as I think they as I think they probably would maybe in sort

(07:37) of 10K batches over time um maybe they'd sort of looked at DCA out of it in a way but um I wonder would they sell on the open market or would they be more likely to do you know when for instance when Tim Draper uh bought all his Bitcoins a few years ago they he did that via auction didn't you I think it was was it the Marshall Service uh auctioned it off and and he snapped it up at at a fairly decent discount so I kind of feel that they probably do something like that or just do some OTC trades via you know coin uh coinbase or

(08:09) whoever it would be so um yeah I think I don't see them I don't see them sort of really uh really looking to take it down that way but it is an interesting it is an interesting kind of sort of Damocles to have uh sort of dangling over the market and um yeah who knows like maybe uh maybe if the price does pump and the debt ceiling issues are still a problem maybe maybe they'll be forced to sell who knows okay I love you I love you but you've got more faith in my government than I do and I live in the United States the the

(08:44) guy from London's like these guys are going to strategically do and they're going to really think it through and I'm like are we talking about the same government man I hope guy I hope you're right I don't see it have been the British government Rob they would have sold it they would have sold it years ago when it was in three figures or they probably wouldn't have been a or they wouldn't they would have lost it put it like that yeah they'd have sent it to a wallet and lost the

(09:04) keys so you know at least your government's still apparently has access to it fair enough well I appreciate those responses um I I I I I do think I I'm pretty sure the last time it sold it was actually a bit below the current prices I think I saw someone say that like if they had just held on you know it would have been worth another 90 million what they ended up selling um yeah but again I mean this is just pocket change to the US government it's not like it makes a huge difference if it's if it's not Plus or you know plus

(09:36) or minus a few uh even a few billion isn't going to make a huge difference but um the next question and I'm online though then down the line because obviously central banks are going to be able to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets from I think it's January 2025 so maybe you know I guess I hope for your guys for you guys sake for you and America's sake so that they'll uh they'll hold on to some of it um until then because I think it's going to get you know a lot more valuable when that

(10:06) proposition comes into play so let's open yeah let's hope Uncle Sam has some has some Diamond hands I guess yeah it's sort of like when does the next Paradigm Shift actually occur right that gets us to because it occurs every few years right with Bitcoin where you just kind of you go up to some new levels and kind of redefines what it means to have have like one Bitcoin um the next question is actually still along the lines the US government to some degree and I there was a video making its way around Twitter I even

(10:34) retweeted it or quote tweeted it because I thought it was um quite comical and one of the politicians basically said that um he referred to all of us as crypto Bros which I guess uh guilty is charged but um he talked about how like you know crypto Bros just print money out of thin air you know like and and and then he's like well and they'll accuse us of doing the same thing and we're kind of like yeah that's probably true you know like we we accuse the you know and he's like yeah and and and maybe we do but we're

(11:04) the US government you know and I was just like I was like there's got to be some people like watching that that that maybe something clicked right like maybe they're like wait what you know I I think a lot of people just don't think about all the time like how it's just printed out of thin air even though it clearly is I mean we went off any type of standard a long time ago so I'm curious what you guys think about this I mean you know do you think it's going to could it have any type of effect on on

(11:30) non-crypto people finally starting to like wake up uh to the debasement of fiat currency just because it's all inflated away um or do you think it's it's not going to really have any type of impact I just saw this video sort of circulating around and you know for a while I was even wondering I was like is this real like is this was this generated by AI like did he really say did he really say this you know um uh guy what do you think what do you think about those comments that the uh that he made isn't this isn't this the world that

(12:01) we're sliding into now where where we're seeing this and instantly having to question whether it's whether it's real or not because yeah I must say I I kind of thought a similar thing I was like did did I hear that right because he sort of he gives a sort of smile halfway through it doesn't he and you think wow oh okay Israel kind of supervillain stuff um I I would like to think that maybe there are a few people out there who have saw that and the penny dropped I I'm not all that hopeful because I think

(12:36) probably most of those people uh you know who've come to that realization are probably already in in crypto to begin with so yeah it's but it was a kind of startling emission and I guess it kind of it just exposes the Fiat system for what it is doesn't it you know the the only thing the only thing backing the dollars in circulation really is people's trust in the US government and once that trust goes and I guess I guess you could say remarks like this guys weren't it was it Brad Sherman was that

(13:11) the guy who who was in the video I think it was um but yeah you know remarks like that aren't going to help but once that trust goes that's it the dollars the dollar is going to is going to go into Decline and I guess you could I guess you could argue that the Dollar's already in Decline but um yeah it's it was It was kind of an extraordinary thing to see as uh it might have been you Ben who pointed out but um yeah basically saying that the quiet part out loud yeah like I just haven't I don't think

(13:42) I've ever heard any of them verbally say you know just verbally acknowledge that like that's what they're doing you know and I it's like I wonder if anyone's listening I guess I guess the headline is politician tells the truth yeah which is crazy an extraordinary thing in itself isn't it yeah it's crazy Rob what did you think I mean did you watch the video did you have any any thoughts on it yeah I watched I watched both there was well there was there was that piece and another piece where he says that all

(14:09) crypto investors I don't think he's I don't know if he said crypto bro specifically he said but they are uh essentially dodging um taxes all right so everybody who's yeah everybody's in crypto is dodging taxes and to talk about you know the first thing where he just pretty much says it out and does this really affect people the thing it affects it really doesn't affect us because we know these things right and if you're watching this video right now you know these things but how many times have you tried to

(14:40) explain Bitcoin and how CPI numbers work and how inflation is actually robbing you and how it is like a silent tax how many times have you had to explain it to your friends and family and they're like yeah okay I get it they don't get it it's like the people that are awake are the ones that are going to do well in these markets and the ones that just stay asleep and it's not their fault I was like that was the same way I was just like head down do work do my you know 60 80 hours a week at my job and

(15:07) make money and I'm good to go I think these types of things don't get picked up unless you're a attuned to it and that's just unfortunately how it is with that part um I mean look we all knew that's that's how it was you print money and and the government does it I know people will talk about inflation is is it it's driven by by demand and these these external forces and Milton Friedman uh uh one Nobel Prize for economics uh said it very clearly he goes there's only one place where inflation is produced is

(15:40) right here in Washington DC by politicians and he went on a record of said he said it many many times and people just try to just go against that it's not that the way it's just you print more money it goes into circulation and uh you you can't buy as much many things and then talking about uh what Sherman said about the the taxation as we're dodging things I don't understand where he comes from with that but what it really is if you look at the narrative that the politicians try to push Senator Elizabeth Warren what is she

(16:09) talking about she's like Bitcoin is bad because of of the environmental factors then you got Sherman saying and of course no one really questions it because they say Bitcoin bad and now you got this Sherman guy go and say Well they're dodging taxes and they're dodging taxes that's taking money away from you these two narratives are very dangerous because they're not 100 accurate but it doesn't matter because people don't really want to get into the the minutia of it and they just say Bitcoin bad

(16:34) crypto bad FTX bad Voyager bad Celsius bad that's the only thing that they really have to do as politicians is to move their constituents in a certain way so for that one and as far as like dodging taxes things like that I gotta tell you I paid a lot of taxes I mean even though I was in in Puerto Rico even me when I when I moved over there I still had to pay all the taxes from what I brought over because you don't just get you know no capital gains tax it's you still have to pay it if you brought

(16:59) it over so when I talk about this I just don't see where it is but you know that's just my thoughts I mean it's true it's like um people have you know there's there are all sorts of people that have not paid their taxes going back centuries you don't have to have crypto to you know to find someone who's who's trying to do that so it seems like a really you know yeah sorry I'm sorry one last thing I will say this if I want to avoid taxes I can't deal with crypto everything's on chain and if I was

(17:30) illegally doing things it's not going to be doing the crypto you know what the greatest thing and don't just just between us no one's really watching uh if I wanted to uh Dodge any kind of transactions I would do it in cash you can't track cash cash is great and I may or may not pay certain people in cash and don't claim those things just saying and uh no one will ever know and of course with Bitcoin transactions or every transaction on chain good luck because they're gonna find you well

(17:57) let's hope we don't do this go to the uh the cbdc route right oh my God yeah you're right you guys are right yeah um the the next question is is kind of more of a boring question it's just about CPI kind of feels like one of those things we have to talk about uh because we did just get a CPI report but I mean we're generally seeing progress in some sectors like headlines down um the you know core CPI though is still relatively sticky and it hasn't moved this year it's basically just been right

(18:26) around five and a half percent for the duration of this year uh I'm curious if you guys like what are your thoughts with regards to the FED um do you think they're going to be satisfied with the progress made and um you know where do you think that that you know puts us in terms of Ray Hike's guy I remember we talked about this a month and a half ago or something and and you your your prediction back then was that they would raise another 25 basis points which they did um so I'm curious you know now that

(18:56) they've done that now that you know now that they have raised that 25 we are to five and a quarter where do you see that what do you see them doing doing at this point with this information um yeah I I mean the consensus it's it's now sort of well above 90 for them for them pausing at the next meeting what's interesting uh I noticed about the next meeting is that um the uh the CPI for for May the CPI for this month will come out on the 13th of June which I believe is one day before uh the next fed meeting so that

(19:31) could be that could be really spicy um that'll be that'll be an interesting day I think anyhow um that aside yeah the consensus is that they'll that they'll keep rates where they are and yeah that would be that would be my guess as well I think they'll want to probably see just how it plays out with rates held at this at this level and I mean Jerome was was Keen it was sort of keen to say in this press conference wasn't he obviously the next decision will depend on the data and obviously as I said that data is

(20:01) coming out just before the meeting so I I imagine it'll be a fairly it'll be a fairly long meeting that they'll have um but he did also didn't he did kind of leave the door open for further rate hikes and I think probably it is quite a useful thing for the FED to have in its Armory this sort of the possibility of another rate hike just sort of hanging like a again like a Sword of Damocles I guess over the over the market and just perhaps from you know perhaps to kind of just temper expectations stop people

(20:34) getting too carried away um and you know just have that thing up their sleeve so yeah my guess would be that uh that rates will probably stay the same at the next meeting um depending of course on on the data that comes in before then um and then kind of looking ahead I mean uh interest rate Futures are now sort of pointing towards uh you know a cut sort of coming fairly soon and I think I saw I think there's a around a sort of 37 chance of a cut by July so it seems to be the that that is that that could be

(21:10) on the cards but yeah I don't think we'll see a cut uh next month for sure I think that I think probably stick to the plan hold them there and and see what happens and I guess see how the markets react to that I'm you know I imagine as it'll probably be what's expected uh it would probably you know it'll probably stay fairly calm but who knows and of course a lot depends on that uh on that CPI figure on the 13th of June I think that's going to be an interesting one yeah I was just checking there because

(21:40) it updates like every you know it updates constantly now it's not a 47 chance of a cut in July and the yeah well and the scarier scarier statistic is that there's an 83 per almost an 84 chance of a cut in September um it's a and it's just like a 50.8 chance of a 25 basis point rate hike or a cut and then another 33 chance of going back down to 4.

(22:08) 75 um so they're again the reason why it's scary is because like what would have to happen between now and then to make the FED want to cut like 50 basis points you know um probably nothing good and then also there's that we're also going to get another um unemployment report too between I mean now in the next meeting so yeah I mean a lot A lot's up in the air Rob what are your thoughts here I mean what are your thoughts what the fed's going to do you think they're done you think they uh they'll climb higher I have no

(22:36) idea fair enough I don't know uh and then I want to say this I think that the unemployment rates uh will not be will not be rising like they like seems like it just it's pretty sticky that's the stickiest one right now because so many job openings and people can't fill the positions but uh I I I don't know and I will just say like I'm just gonna do the same thing I've done before which is the CPI numbers come out you know and and they decide they're going to cut I'm just it's I play the same way if they if

(23:01) they do cut and they say okay you know we're gonna you know cut it by x amount 25 basis points then uh I will just uh you know wait a little bit and then watch for the market to drop then do my daily BCA buys if they come out and say we're not drunk we're not cutting whatsoever we're gonna keep it the same we're gonna you know hold study and the price will probably rally so I'll just buy I mean immediately as soon as I hear it so I don't want to take too much time for this I do want to go back to one

(23:26) thing that guy said uh which was the central banks are going to in 2025 you talked about holding potentially Bitcoin I know that's uh you know gold is is on the on the table but was that one of the videos that you did before because I can't I found that quite interesting 2025 central banks Bitcoin what's up yeah now we have we have uh covered that in I I think we've mentioned it in a couple of videos um and yeah is it oh is it the bank for international settlements I think has mandated that that that's going to be

(24:00) that's that uh it's going to be interesting to two percent if I remember rightly so they you know they can't necessarily all all a pin uh and go nuts but yeah they'll be allowed to hold I think it's two percent um of their reserves in uh in in Bitcoin and or I think it's other cryptos as well but um certainly Bitcoin so yeah I think and obviously I think there could be there could well be you know what's to say that they're not already accumulating that in advance I don't know that that's

(24:31) pure speculation on my part but um yeah I think that could that could be an interesting factor and obviously early 2025 yeah that could that's that's certainly something that's certainly a date that I've I've got in my got in my sights that's crazy because we look at the four-year Cycles doesn't that coincide with everything we just been talking about 2024 is a Bitcoin having around April and then we go into usually all geez Louise everything kind of points to that and even when we go into a to a recession

(24:59) 100 sessions last 10 and a half months we get that at the end of the year then we go into this when's the next presidential election well 2024 November new president takes over 2025 in uh in January man that's that's interesting I'm just I'm just speculating just speculating what's up man when did we have an inverted yield curve in 2019 and then when did we have a recession scare in 2020 right now we have another inverted yield curve in 2023 and yeah it's um it's definitely interesting

(25:26) we're making gonna be an interesting time to be alive I think late 2024 early 2025. yeah to uh too too early to explore the universe too late to explore the the Earth just in time to explore the cryptographers right um that's a good one exactly what are your so we're actually making pretty good time and I you know one of the reasons I say that is because I'd like to get to some questions in the audience so let's try to let's try to keep with a good time and make sure that we can um get those questions so the next question

(25:59) look there's been a lot of a lot of meme coins um you know pumping up and whatnot and and and they're not all necessarily meme coins you'll find different you know different things moving but I'm curious you know like we've seen these types of environments before and how do you how do you guys deal with it because there's so I feel like there's a lot of people that you know just like they they see something promoted somewhere and they just like they YOLO in you know and they you know they just YOLO into it and then

(26:27) they end up they end up holding the bag like six months later so I mean I'm just curious like how do you guys navigate crypto during a time when it seems like the things that should maybe go up aren't and the things that really shouldn't be going up are um what are your thoughts Rob I'll just say like this this may come as a surprise but even I get fomo and I've been in this game since 2017.

(26:55)  so when I see like a Pepe coin going up I'm like um that sounds that looks pretty interesting maybe I should yeah I should get into that and I had to slap myself in the face and go that is not going to work out in the long run and uh and sometimes it sometimes I know like like a week ago or somebody that someone goes rob you should really get into Pepe and and uh I said I'm not here to hold your bags and then this is on Twitter and of course he said remind me of this in one week and of course Pepe goes up so I was like yeah I was wrong but I think now

(27:21) Rob I that's I don't know where is pet Bitcoin now I have no idea I I don't even like pay attention either I'm just curious oh where is it let's find out someone will tell us in the uh in the comments but the the thing is though is to get into this is that all these meme coins and all these things that really don't have any utility I mean even on the website it says this this coin doesn't have utility it doesn't have a uh a road map and we're not developing now that may have changed as they made

(27:52) so much money but that's pretty much how it was in the beginning so when I look at this deck I'm like why are we why are we getting into this and I'm not going to say that you shouldn't do this or you should do this I'm not your dad and I can't give you Financial advice so when I talk about this go ahead and make money that's great but just know that the people that are buying Pepe coin are the people within our community trying to do it and it really is gambling if you want to gamble

(28:17) that's cool 100 you know 50 bucks whatever but if you're putting your life savings and just really going for it you know balls out and you do all these things just know that for you to be successful you have to dump on a lot of your people and there's always going to be that element of it so if you're okay with that and going well I'll just take a little liquidity from the 25 50 person and just make a bunch of money sure go right ahead me personally I can't do that because that doesn't

(28:45) make sense to me I don't believe in Pepe coin and the reason like if here's a question if Pepe drops by 50 are you still going to believe in it because of the tech are you like you know what I'm just here for the money it's the same thing with Bitcoin like we just talked about if Bitcoin with a 10K would you still believe in it and the narrative that is probably so and it has a bigger chance to rebound because we believe in the store of value believe that it's money we believe all those things that

(29:08) we talk about so for me I look at it and I I taught this yesterday crypto's a casino and it's uh it gets annoying sometimes when people are doing this and they're yoloing and they're they're bragging about their their profits and I'm like you just give an ammunition to all the all the politicians that are out there writing the rules so for me I try to stay away from it I don't really talk about it too much and I'll let the gamblers gamble I live in Vegas for two years so I can definitely see that from

(29:33) a mile away that's it fair enough guy uh how do I deal with it I well I I Channel my inner Ben Karen and I close my eyes and I chant Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin Thomas until the until the fomo goes away um no I I yeah I I I kind of adopt a sort of pessimistic attitude to it whenever I hear about it when I heard about Pepe I automatically assumed Matt the fact that I've heard about it probably means it's too late so I kind of try and get myself in the mindset where I just assume that I'll be one of

(30:12) those people who loses my who ends up losing money on it um and that that quite often does the trick and I always remember the fact that when you know when fomo really kicks in I mean places like Twitter particularly bad for it aren't they because you see all these people talking about how much they've made or you know reposting these pictures of wallets that invested 200 and now worth 8 million or whatever it is but I always I always I always kind of take myself back to the fact that you only ever hear about the

(30:42) successes you only ever hear about the people who made out like Bandits you don't hear about the people who lost two hundred dollars four hundred dollars ten thousand dollars whatever it is you don't hear about those guys um and they are you know they're much more numerous so yeah like you said Rob it's it's it's not a it's not a it's gambling it's not a mortal sin in my eyes so if you you know if you have if you've got the stomach for it um then you know knock yourselves out

(31:14) but um I yeah it's it's it's it's troubling and I think I said this touched on this last week didn't I when uh when I said that this sort of thing tends to worry me more or in in a bull market when there are lots of people new to the space and you can just you just know that a lot of people are making perhaps their first crypto trade or whatever and losing their shirt on it and you think Ah that's they're gone they're lost forever they're not going to come back um they're not going to be in it for the

(31:43) tech long term um so as I said then like at times like this yeah people I think most of the people the vast majority of people trading with Pepe and everything else kind of know what they're doing I think have probably made their peace with it at least I hope they have so yeah at times like this I do find it quite interesting just to sort of sit back and and watch it you know I try not to get I try not to get sort of too wound up about it because I mean yeah we've we've been in crypto for a while now so we've

(32:16) seen these things come and go and they'll be you know there'll be other ones along before too long um and I do sort of think as well with this particular in this situation that we're at at the moment where we've had sort of okay we've had a market the Market's gone up uh over over the course of this year so far but I do sort of feel that perhaps all this craziness happening at the moment is kind of maybe draining the last of the speculation out of the crypto Market at least I I hope it is so perhaps That Could set the

(32:49) stage for a more a more sort of sustainable rally in the long term you know we just need to we just need to go through another meme coin cycle to sort of cleanse everything and then we can all move forward into the light I don't know um that said I mean I'm just I'm really just keeping my powder driver when they put out hide the pain Herald coin and I can I canape in on that Twitter [Laughter] someone someone's building as we speak oh I mean it's already created I'm sure it's already created at this point it

(33:23) only takes two seconds um yeah yeah so we have one more question but between now and not between now and the end of that question if you guys have any questions for um for any of us up here make sure you go and ask those in the chat we have plenty of time um we try to get through these as quickly as we can I think Rob did a poll Rob did a poll not too long ago asking and I think people generally would like to see a little bit more interaction with the audience so are we gonna try to do that final question it's a short one

(33:48) if and maybe we've done this question before I couldn't remember but if you weren't doing crypto if if you weren't doing this stuff like if you weren't making videos and whatnot what would you be doing like let's just say you you weren't in the crypto verse I'm curious like what what do you think you would be doing instead um guy um one thing uh one thing a lot of people say to me uh is that um they like the sound of my voice and a lot of funnily enough a lot of women have come

(34:16) up to me and said oh my husband goes to sleep listening to your videos or I like to feel I like to think maybe you know I I don't know how I would have discovered it but I'd like to think maybe I'd be uh narrating a popular sleep podcast or something like that I've got a bit I've gotten a bit obsessed with sleep uh over the last couple of years because I'm convinced I I never get enough so um maybe I'd be doing that sort of putting my supposedly very uh my supposedly calming voice to

(34:45) uh to good uh good work um I I like to think though probably I like to think I'd be writing in some way that's what I was doing before crypto I was I was teaching I was teaching writing um and that's been one of the great things about this because obviously I do you know a lot of uh presenting for the channel and stuff like that but I am kind of you know I am writing out uh research and and stuff for videos as well which I which I really enjoy and it's it's great because I'm not always

(35:14) the most disciplined person when it comes to just sort of sitting down and writing I need a uh you know I need a reason to do it so um that's been one of the things that's pleasantly surprised me over the last few years I find I'm writing sort of more than I ever did before when I had much more sort of free time much more leisure time if you like um so perhaps doing something like that or maybe maybe just working outside in some sort of capacity and I think perhaps that's been informed by uh by

(35:46) the last few years you know I've spent so much time in a darkened Studio or in front of a laptop I like to feel that I like to think that maybe you know maybe uh maybe or my next calling perhaps would be uh would be just outside in in the fresh air for sort of 10 hours a day but um yeah it's it's an interesting question because I did I did wonder that recently and there's um as my wife sort of pointed out she not so long ago she said you know this is this has been quite a plot twist for you over the last

(36:19) over the last few years you know I don't think I don't think anyone really saw that coming and I have to agree so it does it does sort of make me think like yes where what on Earth would I be doing but um yeah there's there's a few options it could be like the uh like David Attenborough of the cryptoverse right the investors slowly invest in the meme coin um the frog in a world yeah exactly you could have been like uh the the the over the over voice for all the different movies out there makeup

(36:54) I'll be like Morgan Freeman a short clip where you just say the Bitcoin dominance will go up and then that way people can like listen to it as they go to sleep each night and then people start thinking about it um Rob what about you yeah yeah I'll make this short uh I'll be bored out of my mind quite honestly because the reason why I did this is because I kept talking about crypto too much to my friends and family like shut up so I just did a start a channel so if it wasn't for this it would probably be back into uh

(37:24) I'd probably go more Hands-On with my Amazon business or my or the sports facility here and manage that and probably get into Property Management which I don't like doing but I'd have to do something to keep myself busy and I wouldn't be doing uh this this thankfully gives me a little bit of purpose and uh gets me to not you know delve into that stuff so that's probably what I would do a very boring type of stuff but uh yeah that'll be it so thank God I got this channel keeps me busy yeah well what about you what about

(37:53) you Ben yeah Ben would you would you be teaching right now no I'd probably be I don't know I I mean I I was working at a National Lab before I was doing this so I probably would have not quit that job my my background's in nuclear engineering so I imagine I'd be doing something related to uh to research and nuclear engineering probably something more productive than what I'm doing now we could use you over there Ben we need nuclear power badly in a safe way and and we needed to you know for like uh

(38:24) disposal which I think is like um and just the energy thing that's uh I think we need that I'm not gonna get on that chance yeah yeah I know it's probably what I'd be uh what I'd be doing um so we have some questions in the chat before we get to those I do want to remind everyone go subscribe to uh to Rob digital Assa news and Guy coin Bureau he's also got coin Bureau Clips uh he's also got coin Bure trading he's got I'm just go looking at the uh his YouTube channel and you can

(38:51) see yeah you can see whichever there's there's several different ones that are linked um but what one question that I have for you guys and I I warned you about this three weeks ago and now I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you E4 or D4 or for chess yeah E4 or D4 I'll give you a hit so E4 if you're more of a tactical person or D4 if you're more of a positional type type player you know Ben I you know I have no like I If if I play chess I'm just like okay let's just you know just I'm waiting for

(39:25) your answer D4 I'm guessing Okay all right in the spirit of in in the spirit of uh disagreeing Rob I think you're totally wrong about it it's E4 all the way good Lord yeah good Lord I'm gonna put this on Twitter you guys are all wrong it's C4 the the English I've actually done so a c boy yes yeah actually actually guy uh C4 is is the English maybe you should have you should have chosen that one um all right this is this chest stuff goes so far over my head it's uh it's unbelievable I was going to ask you Ben

(40:01) though are you perhaps you know perhaps if you weren't doing this would you have gone would you have gone pro with the chess no I wouldn't be Pro like the highest rating I've ever really been in chess is around 1900 or so which is like it's pretty it's like decent but it's not it's nowhere near near the point you would need to be to be like a um like a grand master like to be like a grand master 1900 in the world no no no no no no no just like a rank no like no other ranking but like

(40:31) so like if you're if you're completely new to chess um and you've never really played it before and you start to play or maybe you just know a few things right you're probably like seven or eight hundred ELO maybe you've been playing for if you've been playing for a year maybe you're like 1200 1300 if you've been playing for like a few years you could be like 15 1600 um so the highest I've ever been is 1900 but in order to be like a like an international Master it's more like 2200

(40:57) it's not just dependent on that it's also dependent on how you perform in very certain tournaments and then like Grand Masters after that and then like super Grand Master is anything above 2700. um there's a there's a couple people in the world that are like 2800 but the funny thing is is like the the difference in skill level between me and the best player in the world is is probably less than the difference between that person and and the and a computer like the computers have gotten so good recently that they just even put

(41:27) the uh the super Grand Masters to shame like they make a they make them look like they don't know how to play chess um yeah that's why AI is going to take over yeah how many jobs we really need I think I remember I think I remember Magnus now that you mentioned now that you've explained it Ben I think I remember Magnus Carlson on um on the Lex Friedman podcast I think he was talking he he was one of his Ambitions or something was to maintain like a level and it was yeah it must have been like 27 or 2800 or something it was almost

(41:57) unheard of and he maintained it for a long long time or something yeah it's extraordinary yeah yeah well let's get to some uh less interesting questions other than Charles um it's all downhill from here I think uh so the one question I see is and this is kind of going back to this kind of what so there's the having right and and we sort of talked about the cyclical Behavior Uh but someone wants to know and I I might I might make their question a little bit more broad but they want to know like you know what

(42:30) would happen to a book what would have happened to bitcoin had it been created a few years earlier like before the financial crisis um you know because it was only created after it and then everything went up for 10 years like do you think it would have been a safe haven during the financial crisis or another way another way to think sort of think about this is like you know what would have happened because normally the the price goes up right after the having um and we normally go to highs right like normally we go to highs after the

(42:55) having not before um well like what do you think would have happened if like the sort of the March 2020 like the pandemic stuff like what would have happened if that had been delayed six months you know and I I it's really convenient because for a long time everything is just kind of FL like falling into place like when it IT most easily could have for the cyclical behavior of Bitcoin to make the most sense right like just every four years or so I'm curious like do you guys what do you think if it had been created

(43:22) before the financial crisis and and maybe just think about it in terms of you know what drives is the having or is it something else are you talking about before the financial crisis at 2020. before 2008 2008 oh before it I don't I mean I if it happened before then I think the price would have would have gone up a lot faster because we had so much liquidity and and we were we were still you know printing a little bit of money but once it hit I think it would have crashed a lot harder than most people would have thought because they said see

(43:52) we told you and because no one really to understand what what Bitcoin is some people just get it right and they they invest in Two For the Long Haul and some people like me they don't get it you know for for a long time he's like why would I need this because I look through things as like through the lens of like an American so to me I'm like why do I need this so for here I think it probably would have gone up pretty well people like this is pretty cool but we don't understand the whole concept of it once

(44:19) the uh economy crashes the only people that would would do it really comes out of this the people that really believe in Bitcoin before that accumulated a ton would just have accumulated more as people started to sell off because they didn't believe in what Bitcoin actually does and then they would have accumulated more and then we just would have gone to the same thing again because there's a reason why there's 56 52 million millionaires in the world and there's 2 500 billionaires in the world it's because those people

(44:50) understand how money works and they understand how to make good not just just to accumulate assets and to accumulate you know funds and that's how it'll always be so that's what I think hmm okay yeah it's I get it's it's tempting to think I guess on a you know to to try and see the other side of that it's tempting to think that obviously the we've had this kind of mini banking compared to 2008 we've had this mini banking crisis recently and uh and that's been good for Bitcoin you know

(45:23) Bitcoin is bitcoin's uh existence has been has been proved hasn't it yeah well not proof um bitcoin's use has been proved this hedge against the uh against the the financial system so it's tempting to think that perhaps if it had been around already established when 2008 came that could have potentially been been rocket fuel for it you know here is here is the clearest clearest demonstration you could need that uh that we need an asset that is that is outside of the mainstream Financial system because look at it it's crumbling

(45:54) around our ears um that's true but it would have to be I I think you're right rob it would help it would have to have been sort of it would have to have been very well established by that point because I think if it's been if it had been still fairly new then I think it would have been too fragile and people's people's attention would have been elsewhere and yeah as you say there would have been a handful of crew believers who really understood it who really got it and would have just hoovered up the the rest

(46:23) of the supply but um no it's it's an interesting it's an interesting thing to consider it's um yeah I I tend to I I guess thinking about it I tend to subscribe to that philosophy of sort of everything kind of happens for a reason you know there's and it's I guess I guess we should think I think ourselves as lucky that Bitcoin came along when it did I think and especially looking back at its early years you know it was so touch and go at times whether it would make it it was only because of a a

(46:55) handful of these people who truly believed in it that it did and I think it got you know Lucky in in a lot of respects so I think probably it's just as well it it was uh it was still in satoshi's head when uh when 2008 came because I think that from more likely would have been cataclysmic for it hmm yep I go with that the then what do you think does you you agree or you think like nah it would do way better well I mean during the I mean I so Bitcoin was built or born out of the financial crisis right that

(47:31) was why it was created um yeah but you know why it was created isn't always necessarily how it's going to perform under that type of event but we can see that you know that Bitcoin has gone up during all this banking crisis that we've had recently um so I think maybe you would have seen it go up initially due to the crisis and then maybe maybe down is like even though it's a good even though I think it would have been seen as probably a good thing like if at the end of the day like if people don't have money to buy it because

(48:03) everyone's worried about how they're going to pay their bills like there can be a rush to the exits and that's what there was back then right like everyone just they just sold everything basically that they could get their hands on it was just a a race to the exits because you didn't really know um you know where where things were headed so I I the things that I the more interesting aspect to the question that I think about is everything is lined up so perfectly for so long uh in terms of the cyclical

(48:30) behavior of Bitcoin but I'm like what happens if what happens if we get into a point where like like imagine the unemployment rate doesn't go up and and then we we think we're in the clear and then the having occurs and then and then it goes up like and then the unemployment rate starts to go up like in mid 2024 like that yeah that's sort of what keeps me up like thinking about like you know it will will the cyclical Behavior break down I I lean towards it not like I lean towards just thinking like why why

(48:57) assume it's different uh when so far it hasn't been but um that's something I I think about more and that was sort of the the thing that I was more interested in the question is like what happens when it doesn't line up at some point you know at some point it might not line up in the in the in the best way um that's true I mean it could happen it could happen it could happen this time like you said well right I mean the last time the having was in May and the pandemic drop was in March but what had happened what

(49:25) would have happened if the if the pandemic occurred in like August you know like then we could have had a huge capitulation after the having but it's like we we got fortunate in the fact that it like all these bad events seem to occur and then we get the having and then you know the FED Prince six trillion dollars um yeah thank you thank God for the FED yeah yeah uh it's a good thing it's a good thing they're printing money out of thin air I guess uh we you know we we we uh we learn from them that's right yeah because like why

(49:56) because America that's why we have another good question um so I'm curious what someone asked about the the on and off ramps so we've seen a lot of on and off ramps for crypto sort of disintegrate over the last few months due to regulation and whatnot and and um and so there the the question was like do you think this is going to have a big effect on on new money trying to enter into into the cryptiverse um how could that how could that affect things uh you know going forward guy yeah guy's got another one in this one

(50:30) yeah I think uh well I guess I guess the big money coming into the crypto verse is going to come from institutions now my assumption would be that that a well-capitalized institution is going to have is gonna have some sort of way you know that not available to us to us plebs some sort of way of getting of getting money into crypto some sort of on and off ramp um but certainly certainly it's going to be a lot harder even for them and I guess that could lead them to question and you know it's a valid question isn't

(51:04) it it's like okay well if we're going to put x million dollars into into crypto into Bitcoin for instance then then we have to be we have to be completely certain that we're going to be able to get it out of crypto if we if we need so I think certainly even with those even with those uh those those on and off ramps that are probably you know exclusive to them I think that I think it will still be a bit of a struggle and certainly something that that will be pause for Thought um and then for yeah for retail Traders

(51:38) it is gonna it is gonna make it a lot more a lot more difficult um and yeah I mean we've been seeing this problem it's it's been something in the UK for a while you know lots and lots of banks lots of friends of mine back in the UK who've tried to invest in crypto before I've got messages from them saying Oh my bank is you know it was allowing transfers to to coinbase or to binance and and now it's not and you just sort of One Bank after another seemed to seem to close its uh close its

(52:07) doors to crypto so yeah certainly for re I think the problem would be much more acute for for retail so yeah it's and I guess that's that's very much the thinking behind operation choke points to in the you know in the US it's like I don't why go why go to the why go to the trouble of legislating against it when you can just cut it off at source you know I guess that's a much easier way of doing it just don't let people get their money into it and perhaps assume that eventually they'll get tired and and go

(52:40) and play with go and play with the next shiny thing it's interesting though because you know just because they cut Americans off it's not going to stop it you know it just means that Americans won't have the opportunities that other people have and it'll drive Innovation overseas which is really unfortunate um but it also kind of seems like the world we're going into is as sad as it is uh Rob yeah you know I was thinking about this you know when things will change and it was a great response by

(53:05) guy things will change when uh more individuals and companies start to accept payments in Bitcoin or in ethereum or in whatever you you want to say it like like here's an example like right now for transaction costs for Bitcoin the suit is high 20 but that's not like in 2021 I think we were looking at 80 bucks and more for transaction fees I forgot it was a lot but that's okay because like if if you are worried about like on and off ramp for Fiat here's an example right now we're building a completely

(53:38) new wall around my sports facility right and we're talking like you know forty fifty thousand dollars so for me to and I asked the guy I'm like how do you want me to pay you you know pay you know PayPal Zell you know wire and he's like oh he's like why like cash I'm like I bet you do but I can't do that and I said do you take Bitcoin as a joke and he's like no I don't I don't take Bitcoin I was like I know you don't but I was just thinking myself and the other properties I bought I've asked the same

(54:05) question and only one one uh real estate agent said yeah we do take Bitcoin if you could transaction in Bitcoin or in crypto and then they take that money into their into their Ledger wherever it else it is and then they can take those funds and do whatever they want with it to pay for contractors to pay for goods and services to pay for electricity whatever else that's when things change that's when things shift so these Fiat on and off ramps aren't really so necessary as they are right now because

(54:32) the reason why I need them why you need them and people watch this video need them is because a lot of people only take cash or they take the zeros and ones that are the credit and debit cards and that's really the bigger problem so I I think the Fiat on and off ramps they're necessary right now but hopefully in the future uh they won't be we'll see have you seen that Meme that it's like you know basically like you know when you're saying oh now I can finally sell my Bitcoin the person's

(54:56) like well no when once you're ready you won't have to or so it's like the idea yes yeah like you don't like if you yeah yeah you know what I never I was like yeah right I'm just gonna trade it around but I gotta tell you like dealing with just right this and getting you know funds into this guy like over ten thousand dollars I'm calling the bank and going this is what's happening don't stop this check because I had to remember those things called checks that's what I've been paying it which is

(55:20) ridiculous it's a piece of paper and I make a forge that but whatever that's what the bank's like we're comfortable with that but the other stuff no we're not gonna let you do okay yeah I like never write checks whenever I have to I'm like wait how do I do this again you know yes exactly like I like I can I it's just one of those things that you don't I feel like you know the younger you know especially the generation younger than mine they're not going to have really any experience doing that

(55:43) kind of stuff um so that's why one of the things I think for crypto and that's kind of what I say a lot right is is like like time is on our side in the sense that you know it's the younger Generations that I I think will find the value in new technology whereas it's the older Generations that won't and we'll try to keep it at Bay but you know like 10 years from now as as you you know as as younger people get into office like become you know and and get to make some you know more of these decisions I think

(56:10) that it'll it'll just be um better for crypto um once the people who are are older and don't really care for it or no longer in office anymore um though there's some other you know the next generation will get so your your kids been will get so bored of you talking about how difficult it used to be to get you know how difficult it used to be to buy crypto and yeah we had to cash it out for dollars sitting there with a lightning Network just sending it off oh exactly dad oh tell us that story again please yeah I

(56:44) bought Bitcoin walking to school uphill both ways that's good I I told them the other day we were in the car and uh like I was driving them like swim practice or I think maybe a soccer game or something I I have four kids actually I don't I feel like people don't know that but uh three of them are our boys and they're all in the car and they're all old enough to talk right they're two four and six and I was like can you guys say Bitcoin and and they all just started saying it even the two-year-old and then they just like

(57:13) wouldn't stop saying it they just kept saying Yeah Bitcoin Bitcoin they're like oh this is like my comment section nice we are yeah I know it was funny it was funny um yeah I know I mean it'll be interesting like because I feel like the oldest is is you know at the point where he can start to understand you know like more about like this work because I mean he understands obviously like money and that like things you know you if you need to pay for like we were at a we had a Spring Fling yesterday and there was

(57:45) like a bookstore and he was like you know how much does that cost it's like oh well it costs 500 Satoshi no um no yeah no it'll be interesting because I I think it'll be great to um teach them about that stuff um what happens then when you're driving them to swim practice next week and you just hear a voice from the back seat go Pepe that's when you're gonna have a problem yeah I'll have to have a half Tower he might he might be grounded if that happens he's like but Dad I made my mind than

(58:19) you because I traded it I was like yeah okay um all right um one more question and then we're gonna go um let me see if there's a good one um someone asked me how old my daughter is she's zero she's three months old um oh man I don't know where you get the time been yeah oh here's a good one um this is just more of a reminder who's going to the uh the Bitcoin Miami but I'll say there's also the uh guys conference as well in in June um so Bitcoin Miami is next week guy uh you want to remind people about about

(59:00) your conference the following month yes yes thanks Ben yeah um the coin Bureau conference is next month 10th of June in London um yeah still a few tickets available if you're quick yeah yeah all right yeah so the the 10th of June what's the website so they know oh yes um uh live.coin bureau.com is uh yeah is where you can get uh where you can get those tickets and uh yeah we've got some fabulous people appearing including I should say of course uh Rob from digital asset news uh he's the he's

(59:41) going to be headlining um so uh yeah no it's gonna be it's gonna be a really really fun day I think last year was last year was brilliant um and obviously everything you know everything's kind of changed in the interim so there's going to be so much to talk about it's going to be really good fun I think yeah it seems like a lot of fun and uh Bitcoin Miami is next week and I I will definitely be at that one um and at some point during the conference I'm planning on like getting a room I think we already maybe have it

(01:00:10) to try to meet meet people um because I don't really get out a whole lot as I said I have four kids but so when I do get out I want to meet as many people as I can because the next opportunity could be a long ways away uh so yeah so two conferences coming up all in the next couple of months and um looking forward to see people maybe I'll even be in my Bitcoin Miami who knows yeah maybe you will be but we'll see maybe I will yeah um all right I think we'll wrap it up there it's uh it's it's a little after

(01:00:41) um the top of the hour so we'll wrap it up there guys if you're if you're new uh to NFA live just a reminder we do this every Thursday on on a different Channel we're gonna need to figure out what we're gonna do next week because I will be uh at the conference on on Thursday so I don't know if we're if we're gonna if I'll try to stream it from there or if I will um you guys might have a guest or maybe we'll do it earlier in the week uh obviously a lot of different options

(01:01:08) we'll figure that out but next week it will be on uh Rob's channel uh right I believe that's right so again make sure you subscribe to Rob and Guy their links to their channels are down in the description below um and then that way you are alerted for the next NFA live uh thanks for coming guys we'll see you we'll see you next week
