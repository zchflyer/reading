(00:00) circadian rhythms underpin almost every aspect of our health and well-being and that was the bit I wanted to get across within Lifetime and that we in a sense avoid these rhythms at our Peril for biology to function it requires the right materials in the right concentration delivered to the right tissues and organs at the right time of day and it's the Circadian system that delivers this extraordinary temporal structure what are the consequences of ignoring this biology as we do for night shift work 24 7 society and it's not all

(00:33) doom and gloom by understanding this biology we can very much enhance our health and our well-being hey friends and welcome back to Deep dive the weekly podcast where every week I have the immense privilege of sitting down with academics and entrepreneurs and authors and creators and other inspiring people and we find out how they got to where they are and the strategies and tools we can learn from them to help us live our best lives now this episode is very exciting it is an interview with Professor Russell Foster

(01:00) who is the professor of circadian neuroscience and head of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford he has recently published this new book lifetime the new science of the body clock and how it can revolutionize your sleep and health and so in this episode I asked Professor Foster all about the Circadian rhythm the body clock and all the different practical actionable strategies that we can use that take advantage of our circadian rhythms and our body clock to help level up our health in terms of our eating and

(01:27) our exercise and our nutrition and our sleep crucially so I hope you enjoy this conversation what is the difference between your book Lifetime and why we sleep fundamentally I approach the the the the project really from a circadian basis so a 24-hour biology so essentially everything is being adjusted to a to to a lesser or greater extent by this internal body clock asication rhythms sleep is part of it and so I've taken a much more sort of global look at our 24 uh our biology and made Sleep part of that but not the main focus okay

(02:02) yeah because the subtitle the new the new signs of the body clock and how it can revolutionize your sleep and health yes I guess so it's it's kind of weird so like I mean I went through six years Medical School two years working as a doctor we did so little on circadian rhythms Beyond like a second year and neuro lecture on the eyes where eyes are so complicated anyway it's just like oh my God photoreceptors and this all of all of the things that circadian rhythm wasn't was very much an afterthought

(02:27) sleep was very much an afterthought nutrition was very much an afterthought there was only really when I read why we sleep that I started to be like oh the circadian rhythms are in fact a thing and then listening to a few Cuban lab episodes about it around kind of getting light in the morning versus not in the evening oh wait a minute caffeine a dead and you know adenosine and all these things which kind of words that I picked up from medical school but didn't quite apply to the context of how we can actually improve our lives so I guess

(02:53) like what is what's going on with with the body clock broadly where do we where do we start the discussion well I I think the the remarkable thing for me is that we've spent 20 25 30 years trying to understand how these endogenous 24-hour oscillations are generated when I started um and I and I moved from the UK to to the States this was the focus how does the clock tick and some of the great people you know the Nobel Prize in 2017 uh you know Ross bash uh Hall uh and young we would come to University of Virginia because we're

(03:30) all part of the same National Science Foundation Center for biological timing give talks and they used to get it wrong a lot um but as the data accumulated and the and the facts changed they corrected the story and so what we had by the Nobel Prize was a pretty complete understanding how you can generate a biological clock which is completely awesome you know essentially you've got a bunch of clock genes which are turned on they produce a bunch of proteins they form a complex they go into the nucleus they turn those genes off

(04:04) um the proteins are then broken down and then they're released from this inhibition and can start producing more proteins again so you have this 24-hour oscillation in protein production and then degradation and that's the the essence of the clock and and certainly I was in involved in Earl experiments showing that the master clock in the brain is a group of 50 000 cells called the suprachiasmatic nuclei and we thought that would drive rhythmicity uh and it would impose a 25 24-hour order on the body we got that wrong in a sense

(04:38) every cell in the body has this internal clock and so what you've got is a master clock in the brain then coordinating the rhythmic activity of billions of individual cellular oscillators throughout the organ systems of the body fine-tuning our biology to anticipate the very demands of activity and rest in the day night cycle and so with that Exquisite mechanistic understanding and the knowledge for example that a single amino acid change in one of those clock genes can either make you a morning person or an evening person is so good

(05:13) it's the best system that we have of understanding how genes and their protein products interact to generate behavior and it's still the best example we have so but in parallel with that Exquisite mechanistic understanding which is really my background because I'm interested in how light interacts with the master clock and regulates it was the appreciation that circadian rhythms underpin almost every aspect of our health and well-being and and that was the bit I wanted to get across uh within within Lifetime and

(05:48) that we in a sense avoid um or ignore these rhythms that are apparel uh because if you think about it for biology to function it it requires the right materials in the right concentration delivered to the right tissues and organs at the right time of day and it's the Circadian system that actually delivers this extraordinary temporal structure and so um what are the consequences of of of of ignoring this biology as we do for night shift work 24 7 society and you know that that wonderful arrogance of Being

(06:22) Human I mean part of our extraordinary um achievement has been that we believe that we're independent of the constraints of of The Grubby world of biology and we're not you know and it was really I think it was a bit of a wake-up call to think hang on um you need to think about this and it's not all doom and gloom by understanding this biology we can very much enhance our our health and our well-being love it so okay so I have so many like specific questions but I wonder if we so if we start more

(06:52) further Upstream so you've got super casual cosmetic nucleus where there's 50 000 cells or so that are sort of the Master Clock your body and they're somehow helping regulate the other billions of cells that we have in the body which also have some level of like circadian rhythmicity to them yes what let's say it's night time for a cell versus daytime for a cell in like I don't know the the finger like what difference does it actually make the clock's a a sort of made in broadly the same way it we don't think there's

(07:22) any fundamental difference in the Master Clock compared to a finger clock for example uh but they're phasing the alignment of those clocks can be very different and it's and it's essentially how they take their reference cue from from the master clock that's important now what you've got is a a master clock and it's no use to anticipate these daily changes unless it's set to the real world and so our interest has been well how does the Master Clock use the dusk Dawn cycle the light dark cycle to

(07:54) regulate internal time and that's really how I got into this sort of mechanistic side of things and the appreciation that in fact it's not the visual cells the rods and cones that are providing this light dark signal it's in fact a third photoreceptor in the eye and so the eye we can think of it I mean it's you know obviously the eyes so cool in lots of different reasons but it's both the organ of of space through vision but it's also the organ of time because of its regulation of the internal Master

(08:21) Clock in the brain and if you don't have eyes you are both um space blind but also timelined and in fact we're working with blind veterans UK those individuals who have radical eye damage or have they've lost their eyes they're they're drifting through a world without time these are extraordinary individuals um very very keen to be independent and some of the some of the discussions I've had you know one chat was telling me I feel so angry because I feel my body is trying to trick me all the time and went

(08:56) on to tell me about a story whereby he knew that Wednesdays is when he he cut the grass and so he woke up I think knew it was a Wednesday because that was the next day I went downstairs and had worked out a way to cut the grass being completely blind and then uh his wife came down and said it's 3am in the morning and you're going to drive the neighbors crazy and and it was that incredible sense of frustration it's essentially it's a bit like unremitting jet lag for the rest of your life and so

(09:27) the most recent work that we're doing is you know we could discover these new photoreceptors and that's so kind of cool you've got this this dual function of the eye but but it's really working out how they interact with a molecular Clockwork and we're now at a stage where We've Got Drugs which can mimic the effects of light on the clock and the research I'm doing now is to try and develop those drugs so that we can give them to individuals with radical eye disease no eyes and give them back a sense of

(09:55) biological time it's not just actually the profoundly blind um we've done quite a bit of work in the space of uh psychiatric illness so the Sleep weight patterns of individuals with schizophrenia are are utterly smashed I mean I to an extent I would never have believed until we've done the studies and so I also see a role for those drugs in uh correcting as an acute corrector of the circadian sleep wake cycle and then hopefully not to use drugs and then then use light but as an immediate corrector

(10:30) um in the context of Alzheimer's and Dementia the reason my kids will send me off to a nursing home will be because I'll be wandering around in the middle middle of the night terrifying grandchildren if they ever producing it but you know seriously if if we could um delay the point at which one has to sort of send an aged relative to the nursing home because of their massively disrupted sleep wake this would be incredibly beneficial uh beneficial beneficial you know for the healthcare sector and but also the the emotional

(11:02) trauma that families go through uh when they have to make this very painful decision so so by understanding the nature of biological time I think there's some really exciting opportunities yeah that's really cool um so how does the how do the photoreceptor cell respond cells respond to Dawn and Dusk to regulate it's such a cool question because yeah because they are I mean I got into this because I couldn't understand how the visual cells the rods and cones which grab light in a fraction of a second milliseconds then they

(11:34) forget they've seen that light and that's how we get an image of the world um and if they if they took longer then our visual world will be a blur as we moved our head it would be a series it would be a smear not a series of sharp images and I couldn't see how the rods and cones could extract dawn dusk information over long periods of time and what we did know before we started is that they're really quite insensitive to light so you needed a lot of light for a long period of time and I guess

(12:05) having a background in sensory ecology whereby sensory cells are are fine-tuned to their you know the demands the sensory demand I couldn't understand how a visual cell could also act as a circadian cell so we started working with mice with hereditary retinal disorders whereby their visual cells had largely degenerated they were visually blind but what was so extraordinary is that when we looked at their ability to regulate their circadian rhythms to a light dark cycle and essentially what you do is you put them in a running

(12:39) wheel like a hamster running wheel and look when they run and when they don't run and you get a beautiful read out of their circadian Behavior they could do it perfectly well when you covered the eyes then this ability had gone so there had to be something else in the eye now when we proposed that as I talk about in in the book I mean I remember there was a big big meeting in the states where I said so these data are consistent with the fact that there could well be another receptor system in the eye this person at the back of the

(13:11) auditorium stood up and I thought okay well they're going to ask a question fair enough and I sort of looked at at them and they looked at me and they just said and walked out and you know it got really nasty I mean grants were hit the deck one comment from a referee was is Foster cersling telling us that after 150 years of research on the eye we'd missed an entire light detecting system and so you know I was a bit younger then full of full of um I suppose yeah arrogance yeah um so do yes these These are the data

(13:47) but it took us a decade to to get better and better data ultimately engineering a mouse with absolutely no rods and cones so you couldn't use the argument oh well it's just a few rods and cones left that are mediating this light response and what we discovered is this entirely genetically engineered rodless countless Mouse will regulate its responses to light circadian responses light perfectly normally and that led us to find in a mouse a group of ganglion cells that were directly light sensitive the ganglion cells are the other cells

(14:20) that form the optic nerve of the eye and about one out of every hundred of those is directly light sensitive David Burson found the same thing in in the rat and Denis Stacy found the same thing in monkeys so you know after we we'd slogged away for a decade um then at about the same time we in the mice you know other people in rats other people who might show oh yeah um there's something else and that I think has been really incredibly exciting because it's not just called biology it has direct clinical

(14:52) application and that's where the last gasp of my scientific career was going is is using that information uh hopefully for health and well-being just a quick message from one of our sponsors and and we'll get right back to the episode and this episode is very kindly brought to you by Heights Heights is a brain care smart supplement it is two capsules that you take every day I've been taking it for the last 12 months and it contains over 20 evidence-based micronutrients that you need to keep your brain and body healthy like I said

(15:20) I've been taking Heights every day for the last 12 months and through that I've actually become friends with the founder Dan who we actually had on season one of this podcast and this season we also have an interview with neuroscientist and psychiatrist Tara swart who is the chief science officer at Heights as well and one of the things I love about Heights is the fact that every single thing they do is very evidence-based over on their blog on their website they've got tons of Articles along with

(15:42) links to all of the different papers that they've cited that show all the benefits of the various micronutrients that they've got in these two little capsules and the best thing about taking these is that it's just two little capsules every morning so you don't have to deal with green sludge or any other kind of faffrey it's just literally taking two pills it's super easy to sign up you just go on the website you put in your address and they send you either either a monthly or a quarterly

(16:04) subscription I sign up to the quarterly one myself because a it's cheaper and B I'd have to take fewer deliveries and if you use the coupon code Ali 15 at checkout that will give you 15 off the already discounted price of the quarterly subscription so you can try out Heights to your heart's content so thank you so much Heights for sponsoring this episode and for helping improve my own brain care what was that like when you first did that experiment covering up the eyes of the mice and realizing hang on they lose their circadian

(16:31) activity was that like a Oh My God moment or was it like oh there must be something else going on here no it was it was an oh my God moment because it was consistent with the sort of the theories but when you had unambiguous data so the other thing is of course my background is in comparative biology my first group of zoology and I was I was aware of weird photoreceptors so non-mammalian virtual bits have pineal photoreceptors they have even have photoreceptors in the hypothalamus I mean I know that sounds crazy with huge

(17:05) amounts of light actually penetrate the brain through the skull through the skull and birds for example regulate their seasonal biology that they can detect the increasing and decreasing day lengths with a receptor in the hypothalamus in fact I worked on those before I worked on mammals so the conceptual leap that there could be a weird receptor in the eye wasn't so huge for me because I'd come from a background of weird photoreceptors and I think that's a really really interesting perspective because so much of exciting

(17:38) science is at the interface between different disciplines yeah now you know the chat that said we've been studying the eye for 150 years was absolutely dead right but they've been studying Vision they hadn't been looking for another role for the eye and so you find what you're looking for yeah and so someone with your background where you've been studying these in an entirely different context you put sort of two and two together almost yeah and it really in my undergraduate project was recording from the sort of the

(18:05) parietal eye electrophysiologically from tadpoles and it's so cool because you know Sean Elijah on this tiny little structure and it changes its electrical activity and it probably regulates swimming Behavior did that with my my third year project supervisor Alan Roberts you know and and so uh it was I think that that breadth of exposure to different areas of science is so important and sadly because there's so much to learn these days we don't really have time for the comparative bit Yeah I suppose to get advanced in any one

(18:36) specific field you have to devote your life to that rather than kind of dabbling with other fields or side hustles almost Okay so we've got the ganglion cell in the optic nerve which is responding to light is it responding to amount of light or wavelength like what is it responding to and what's happening then this is what what actually the field is struggling with at the moment because of course what Architects and the lighting industry want is what they call human-centric lighting okay and what we which is

(19:04) basically lighting that optimizes human human function physiology Behavior so what the lighting industry has really focused upon is Aesthetics does it feel nice and is it bright enough for color vision for example so that's been largely um now of course what they want to do is enhance the the light environment for the regulation of the clock um in the industrial setting and also the domestic setting but the problem is we haven't got all the parameters in humans humans are profoundly insensitive to light and we might want to ask one

(19:41) yeah I mean compared to a Mouse a mouse a mouse's circadian system can detect light of one Lux which is you know little more than Moonlight um we get up to a hundred thousand Lux on a bright sunny day so so that's incredibly incentive and in fact it wasn't until 1987 when scientists from Japan show that in fact humans can regulate their circadian system by light it was always assumed and when I was doing my PhD you know when asked that question how do we relate our and regulate our clocks it was always oh

(20:11) well it's when we eat and it's our social interaction and the problem is everybody had been using stimuli that worked brilliantly for mice but it was just not enough and and what what the Hondas did was something like 5 000 Lux for I think it was six or eight hours then they got entrainment yes the regulation of the of the of the internal clock to the external world and wavelength I mean we showed that these new photoreceptors are maximally sensitive in the blue part of the spectrum to be specific 480 nanometers

(20:43) which is the kind of blue you get on a really blue uh blue sky on a beautiful sunny day um why well it could be because at Twilight the Dome of the sky is enriched with blue light across the Horizon you know you see it as orange but if you look up it's that beautiful blue and it's that wavelength where these receptors are most sensitive and of course it's at dawn and dusk when these receptors need to be able to detect the light and so we think but it's a just those story that they're Mac that that

(21:17) they're sort of sensitive in the blue part of the spectrum for maximum sensitivity at that time of day however although we showed there's a separate photoreceptor and we originally conceived it as visual rods and cones non-visual photosensitive retinal ganglion cells actually of course as you might predict with Biology it's more complicated than that in fact we now know that the rods and cones are capable of regulating the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells okay so in fact the spectral range can be quite large you

(21:52) know because the cones go down in humans to what 420 nanometers in the sort of violet area and they go out to 560 which is sort of green orange so how they communicate with the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells is unclear under what circumstances whether they add to the sensitivity and there's some evidence from the monkey literature that they might actually inhibit the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells so from it's a complicated light environment that they're responding to and in fact we and others have argued

(22:27) that it might be if color vision might have evolved to add additional information because of course at Twilight you get a change in the color of the light environment and if you've got two if you've got receptors tuned to different colors they can detect they can ratio those changes and then pass that information on so it might be the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are just doing brightness but they're getting additional time information from the visual cells relating to the changes in the in in the color of the

(22:59) environment now we don't know um but that but there's there's all those really fascinating ambitious the sensitivity issue I think is really why are we so why are we so insensitive to light and I I'm guessing but but it could well be that humans of course have been playing with fire for maybe a million years and of course farlight is quite bright and and it could give a a confusing light dark signal there might have been rapid selection against sensitivity so that these receptors were not overly responding to a bonfire at

(23:36) night exactly yeah uh so so it's tuned to the sorts of light you get in the environment at dawn and Dusk and so what sort of proteins are being up or down regulated once like with with the Circadian yeah cycle so the the key um targets for light activation are two proteins called per one and per two what do pro one and Pro 2 do well they're part of that they're really critical in the feedback but by turning them up or in fact you can inhibit them as well will mean that you'll advance or delay

(24:11) that uh oscillation so you can use them in in nature to align that that clock to the external one I should have said that of course the molecular Clockwork isn't exactly 24 hours so for most of us the body clock is a little bit under constant conditions is a little bit longer than 24 hours so if you or I went to a deep dark cave constant light constant temperature and people of course have done that then we will get up a little bit later and later and later each day and so what happens is that the daily light exposure nudges the

(24:46) clock into alignment by up regulating particularly per one and per two in that in that feedback loop and so once presumably quite a lot Downstream of that you would have I don't know the in the morning the body would decide to be more alert and in the evening would decide to be more sleepy like is is that ultimately what's going on yeah I mean essentially what what the the clock is doing is providing a temporal reference cue for all Downstream physiology and behavior to to to align itself so in anticipation of

(25:20) waking up the uh blood pressure is rising rapidly uh the cortisol levels are rising rapidly um and alertness is is being turned on and of course at the other end of the day those those physiological behavioral parameters are sort of declining or going into a different state I think it's important to say that they're not being turned off they're just going into a different state because sleep is not a shutting down of biology as we've sort of you may well have been taught um even as recently as when you did your

(25:55) medical degree um but in fact it's going to a different state which is a uh as in fact some areas of the brain are more active during sleep than they are during wake and so what's happening whilst we sleep is that um information that we've acquired during the day is then laid to memory uh and uh in those those that new information is then integrated and so if you want to come up with novel solutions to complex problems a night of sleep has been shown to hugely enhance our capability of doing that so the brain is

(26:30) is sort of not only just sort of storing facts it's actually playing with information and coming up with new ideas which is why sleep is so important because it's that incredible capacity that humans have of problem solving and it's sleep that that really helps us to do that same time uh you know the brain is regulating the clearance of a whole bench range of toxins from the from the body um and realigning our metabolic pathways so that the stuff that's been burnt up during the day is then rebuilt at night

(27:01) so we can do it so it's it's it's these wonderful different states of of sleep and wake that are being underpinned uh by the clock and of course it's immensely complicated so you have to have that timing uh uh you know across the day and in space so the right organs are doing the right things just a quick message from one of our sponsors and we'll get right back to the episode and this episode is very kindly brought to you by short form short form is the world's best service that summarizes

(28:41) rereadings doesn't necessarily help as much as I love James clear but the short form guide to Atomic habits is great for revisiting the key ideas anyway if any of that sounds up your street and you would like to sign up to the world's best service that summarizes books then head over to shortform.

(29:23) podcast episodes about this but I just love to get your take on a few of these like frequently asked questions about sleep so um I guess the first one that comes to mind is six hours seven hours eight hours nine hours what what's going on there um I think the key thing for me is that uh one shoe size doesn't fit all right and uh one of the sort of slight frustrations that's emerged is that an average value is taken as the optimum value for all of us and of course it isn't uh across adults for example

(30:00) healthy sleep can range from six hours maybe slightly less than that um out to 10 or 11 hours and so yes there is an average uh but actually there's so much individual variation it's it's it's really I think wrong to impose a specific amount for each of us and the point of the book to some extent is to allow people to Define what's optimal for them how do I do that how do you do that so yeah so how do you know if you're not getting enough sleep well it's you know it's the kind of things

(30:34) our grandparents probably would have told us they've asked that question which is that um do you need a partner or an alarm clock to wake you up in the morning does it take you a long time to wake up do you crave caffeinated and sugar-rich drinks during the day to keep you awake have your friends family colleagues reported that you're showing a lack of empathy increased frustration they may have noticed that you do stupid and unreflective things um and and when given the opportunities to sleep let's say at the weekend and

(31:06) very notably on holiday do you find your sleep patterns change and and it's really defining what each of us needs and then trying to adopt behaviors that defend that sleep pattern and and you know we know for example that the duration of sleep varies enormously between individuals but not only that their timing going back to the molecular clock there are subtle changes which can make you a morning person or an evening person but also going going back to light that can contribute to what's called your chronotype your morningness and

(31:39) eveningness so morning light advances the clock make you makes you get up earlier evening light delays the clock makes you get up later and go to bed later evening light is in dusk light so dusk delays morning advances the clock so you're constantly being nudged backwards and forwards and of course one of the problems of our society is that we don't get asymmetrical exposure to light which can be a problem as in you're not getting an equal amount of advancing and delaying dawn dusk exposure so we looked at a bunch of

(32:16) University students around the world um Australia New Zealand Germany Holland and and in the UK and we show that those were the latest chronotype those that like to get up late and go to bed late we're not getting warning light which would have advanced the clock made them get up earlier they were missing that they were sleeping through the morning but they were getting evening light which would delay the clock which causes them to sleep even though yeah so art sleep timing is dependent upon our genetics

(32:46) and when we see light but also there's another factor which is what how old we are so from about the age of 10 there's a tendency to want to go to bed later and later and later peaks in lateness in males about 21 21 and a half in females about 19. so men tend to be later for longer and then as we age we sort of move to a more morning chronotype the time we're in our late 50s early 60s we're getting up and going to bed at about the time we got up and went to bed when we were 10. and that actually

(33:23) changed almost perfectly correlates with the changing levels of estrogen and testosterone so that sharp rise during puberty and then the sort of decline in into old age so the point I'm making is that not only is there lots of differences between individuals in terms of their their preference for how long they want to sleep and when they want to sleep but it changes as we age therefore it's completely Daft to try and Define the optimum sleep sleep you know at stage the optimum sleep duration you must get eight hours

(33:57) um and and I I think it was kicking back against that which was one of the reasons for for writing the book I mean people have actually come up to me after public talk and as before lockdown and one person said to me I don't get eight hours of sleep am I going to die and I said well I can assure you you're going to die but but it may have nothing to do with your secretary and so people have become um frightened about their sleep rather than embracing the Sleep uh that they get they become anxious about it there

(34:28) was and it's reinforced by Sleep apps it's worth bearing in mind that at the moment No Sleep apps are are um endorsed by any of the sleep federations or FDA approved and of course you know when you look at the validation of many of these these apps um you'll go into the paper and you'll see it work perfectly for eight undergraduates you know or uh in California and that's about it but of course the point I've just made is that sleep changes as we um age and between individuals and so one algorithm is also

(35:00) not appropriate for telling us what good sleep is people have come to me and said oh do you believe in slow wave sleep and I've sort of said yes kind of why and they said well I don't think I'm getting any because my app is telling me I don't get any slow way of sleep and of course these apps are found the um uh they just they can't detect that they don't have the sensitivity to do that and so people can get very badly misled so so so there's a sort of the mantras that are a bit frustrating you

(35:34) must do this you must do that but it's reinforced by sleep app saying we had a good night's sleep or a bad night's sleep and again we should be listening to our own biology using very straightforward um uh sort of criteria that we've just touched upon nice okay I have another um potential myth that maybe you can debunk which I wish I've heard a lot which is that you might think you can get by with six hours of sleep but when you're 65 you're more likely to get dementia and Alzheimer's and stuff so

(36:01) make sure you get your eight hours it's a good point I mean I would not want to marginalize the importance of sleep absolutely but I do think that we need to take responsibility for it now if you are in your middle years and you are you know doing crazy sorts of things in terms of business and all the rest of it and and are chronically sleep deprived then there is evidence that chronic sleep deprivation in the middle years will predispose your risk or increase your risk to Alzheimer's and Dementia so

(36:34) I think that's a serious issue but but again it's horses for courses um and I think most people know if they're they're not getting the sleep that they need yeah um how important is it to wake up at the same time every day I think it is important because it reinforces all of the sort of signals that regulate the Circadian system so eating at the same time uh getting light exposure at the same time that all acts to stabilize however having said that you know there's going to be an occasion where

(37:04) you have a party you're going to get up late you know and sleep is is is very Dynamic it's it's and I really can't emphasize one size does not fit at all yeah and and and because it's such a dynamic and variable behavior um we can you know it's it can be tweaked and it's flexible um yeah the other the other really interesting myth that so many again again people sort of perpetuate the myth it's not only eight hours but it's eight hours of uninterrupted sleep and and of course what we know from uh

(37:39) Roger Eckert's work uh from his historical studies looking at sleep patterns in the pre-industrial era is that human sleep almost certainly wasn't a single eight-hour block uh so so you hear in the literature I had a wonderful first sleep um and uh you know I didn't have such a great second sleep and there's Roger um talks about a wonderful um French uh Doctor Who says uh young couples should make love after their first sleep uh when they are less tired and will be better at it I mean you know

(38:17) so you've got this literature which is sits out there and that then encouraged people like Tom Weir to say okay well let's find out what happens to modern humans if we bring them into the lab give them 12 hours of light 12 hours of darkness and lo and behold you get what's called biphasic uh a couple of episodes of sleep separated by wake or indeed polyphasic which is multiple sleeps with interruptions throughout the night if you look at all mammals again that wonderful comparative perspective all mammals show they don't show a

(38:49) Consolidated bunch of snake it's it's polyphasic or biphasic and indeed societies today without electric light show multiple wakings and seepings so that bit of information is not out there and so when people wake up in the middle of the night think oh my God that's it I'm never going to get back to sleep I'm as I start drinking coffee and do my emails which is nonsense if they stay calm you don't necessarily have to stay in bed you can keep the lights low do something relaxing you will feel tired

(39:19) again and then go back to sleep I know people who you know listen to Radio 4 extra and you know we'll get through one one person until we just the other day they felt found that Melvin Bragg is absolutely spectacular for getting them off to sleep um now that's I mean I love in our time but but you know in the middle of the night that that perhaps that voice is is what's required to just gently get you back to sleep and and again it's it's finding out what works for you what you find relaxing to get you back off to

(39:50) sleep but but so many people are just terrified of of waking in the middle of the night in fact there's a there's a condition recognized now called Sleep anxiety and where people are getting very anxious about going to sleep because they're frightened of how long it'll take to get to sleep but also if they wake up in the middle of the night all right I feel like around the early 2010s there was a bit of a movement of people trying to figure out polyphasic sleep as a productivity tool what's your take on

(40:18) that it's in fact I'm I'm part of a national sleep Foundation which is based in the state's um consensus document on this and you you have these um various patterns whereby uh there's a total of uh something like four or six hours of sleep it may be two hours at night with with various fragmented sleep during the day and all of the data suggests that this is a really bad idea and it's it's sort of become very um popular in the business sector you know where people are saying oh yeah

(40:55) I've you know I've just and actually short term you're probably okay long term uh it's really a bad idea and and you know going back to the point we were talking about earlier uh assessing one's own sleep needs you've got to be pretty careful about it because you can delude yourself the problem is that the tired brain can become so tired it can't detect how tired it is and you know this has been shown in taxi drivers you know asked um do you you know you're okay working for the night shift they say

(41:25) yeah no problem fine you then look at their cognitive abilities and they're you know on the floor uh so you you again need to be genuine in tuned with what your individual sleep needs are and the impact of sleep um disruption just a quick note from one of our sponsors and we'll get right back to the episode and this episode is very kindly brought to you by skillshare if you haven't heard by now skillshare is probably the single best place in the world to learn anything online and the best thing about

(42:49) check out my classes on skillshare and thank you so much skillshare for sponsoring this episode one thing that I I've had in my mind a little bit is because I've heard a bunch of podcasts and things as well that you know you should try and wake up at the same time every morning and preferably on weekends as well because Rhythm and stuff yeah but I'll occasionally have a night where I've had friends over until like 1am and then I'm like okay so I normally wake up at 7 30. if I sleep at 1 30 and like

(43:13) maybe I'll get six hours of sleep is it better for me to just actually wake up at 7 30 or should I just have a bit of a line wake up at 9 30. I think it's fine to have the occasional lion okay and I think this is it I it's these regimental sergeant majors you know it's it's flexible I mean I think we could think of we don't do the same behavior when we're awake and I think during sleep it's again a dynamic uh it's a dynamic behavior and this flexibility clearly there's a baseline you know that we need

(43:42) to achieve but you know it it's a wobbling bass line yeah because I think like over the last couple of weeks I have actually been sort of putting in my journal but like huh I feel particularly tired today oh I only I only did get like five and a half hours of sleep last night because uh regimental Sergeant told me I should wake up at 7 30 even if I'm tired um and of course you know catch up sleep can work you've just got to be very careful about it uh because uh it can mean that you don't get that Morning

(44:08) Light which is so important to set the clock yeah and if you sleep through so yeah it will cause a wobble uh but if you if if the next day you're getting up at the right time then it's it's fine um when you so when you say morning lights um are we talking like what sort of time are we talking what sort of looks like what's what's going on there it's it's outside light is is what we really need uh and I think it's because the visual system is so good at uh adapting to different light

(44:37) levels uh we're not really aware of the fact that we live in dim dark caves most uh sitting rooms uh offices you'll be lucky to get three 400 Lux of light intensity whereas right by a window you'll get on average 3000 Lux uh shading environment will be maybe 10 000 Lux 20 000 Lux bright sunny day 80 to 100 000.

(45:04)  that's a huge difference between even just being indoors absolutely and so that's why Morning Light uh outdoor light is so good maybe the explanation for example why individuals with dogs um are reported to sleep better because of course they have to get up take them for a walk in the morning and they're getting their their morning Photon shower um and that's helping consolidate the sleep wake rhythms of not only themselves of course but the dog and are we talking like five a.

(45:31) m morning or like 10 a.m we're talking I suppose you know seven eight o'clock in the morning I mean certainly the earlier you get up uh if you got up at 5am you would have a big advancing effect upon the clock but most of the time we're talking about a mild modulation just nudging it to keep on track because uh on average and again I don't like to use averages but but the Harvard group have suggested that the human body clock is around about 24 hours and 12 minutes and 10 minutes so we only need a slight adjustment uh

(46:04) every day so it's not a huge adjustment unlike of course when we cross multiple time zones and then we've got one heck of a shift because you know we're eight hours or six hours or going to Australia you know Tour New Zealand 12 hours of time difference and of course it takes about a day for every time zone we've crossed to adjust you know fully adjust so it's a it's a it's a and again it goes back to that wonderful molecule sick one which is buffering the effects of light on the clock because of course

(46:36) it makes sense it doesn't want evolutionarily huge shifting of the clock it doesn't want it to be disturbed because for example you might then if you're a a borrowing mammal emerge from your your burrow to late or too early and be somebody else's lunch yeah so it sounds it sounds like broadly even though we don't like to give prescriptions to people but going for a walk in the morning feels like a very reasonable yes good thing to do and having your breakfast right by a window so in the nursing home environment where

(47:08) it's many individuals don't get out very much and where sleep wake is really awful in some cases and indeed the light environment umran a wonderful colleague from the Netherlands you know put in the nursing home environment big Banks of likes of producing a thousand to two thousand Lux um darkness in the bedrooms and can Consolidated really ragged sleep weight profiles into much more robust sleep weight profiles and what was interesting is that those individuals who showed a stable sleepwear profile uh their

(47:40) cognition went up by almost 10 percent so there's a very nice correlation there with improved sleep and cognition in the elderly simply by regulating the Circadian system one thing I noticed starkly like two days ago I I happened to be in a co-working space on Baker Street and it was quite dark and dim inside I was there for a few hours working on my book and after like I was doing this I was thinking huh why do I feel kind of kind of sad this is a bit weird and then I went out and then I sat in a cafe on Baker Street and I was

(48:10) immediately just like oh my God life is gray I feel so good and I was thinking have I had enough coffee I have another I was like wait a minute it must be like natural light yes where this was quite a dingy co-working space it was quite dark very sort of yellow light and stuff it just felt a bit like there was a well yeah that's a really important observation so so those photosensitive retinal ganglion cells we talked and we originally thought of them as circadian light Regulators then we discovered they're actually part of the pupil

(48:40) constriction is is being is dependent upon those extraordinary new cells and now we know that levels of alertness and mood can be regulated so there's an acute effect of light uh detected by those cells on on our behavior and and in fact there's some really fascinating data showing wonderful study compared uh light treatment which was 30 minutes of 10 000 Lux from a light box okay first thing in the morning versus Prozac versus placebo and by eight weeks Prozac was statistically different from Placebo

(49:20) by two weeks light was statistically different from Placebo and by eight weeks light was much more effective than Prozac interestingly they combined Prozac and light and the two were additive suggesting that they may be operating on our levels of alertness and mood via different regulatory systems so we do we don't know what that what light is actually doing whether it's a direct acute effect you know increasing alertness and engagement in the brain or something else uh so yeah they're turning out I think that's what's so

(49:55) really remarkable because it's not just the regulation of the clock these new receptors they're having a whole role in in a sense an unconscious effect of light on our biology which as you point out you know is important on our mood for example yeah um so there's a lot of people that get kind of seasonal seasonal affective disorder is that basically a light intent density thing from it seems to be I mean I think many of us were very skeptical when this was you know seasonal affective disorder was was was

(50:26) first talked about because what's the control you know you can't see something in front of a light box you know without the lights on because they kind of get it um and then the studies became much more effective and compared Morning Light versus evening light and we've talked about the importance of Morning Light Morning Light was much more effective at regulating sad than evening light and very specifically blue light which is where those photosensitive rectal ganglion cells are maximally sensitive

(50:55) and was more effective than other wavelengths other colors in reducing the effects of of sat um and and so I think it's a real phenomenon friends who are psychiatrists don't think it is they think that's just another form of you know um of of anxiety or or or depression um but but I think the data are now sufficiently strong to show that there's a there's a genuine light effect um precisely what the mechanism is we don't know um what we do know is it's not melatonin and so we're talking about myths earlier

(51:30) yeah so so melatonin is often called a sleep hormone it is emphatically not a sleep hormone okay what is it it's a biological marker of the dark okay which means so if we if we again if if we can go back to my roots um and the comparative what we know about melatonin in mammals is that the expanding Seasons so the increasing dark length in the autumn and winter leads to an increasing uh release of melatonin so melatonin Maps the seasonal changes in light and dark and what uh a sheep or a deer or something will do is use that

(52:07) increasing melatonin profile in the Autumn to trigger reproduction so that there's the breeding and there's um the young are gestating over the winter and they're born in the March when there's lots of lots of fresh vegetation to sustain milk production and weaning um so that's that's the really exquisitely understood understood role of melatonin melatonin if you look at individuals who are on beta blockers and you you reduce their levels of melatonin by over 80 sent then sleep is not is not

(52:42) really affected if you look at quadriplegics why beta blockers uh because it blocks the sympathetic regulation of the pineal gland which then regulates the output of the Melatonin okay so it's easy it's quite interesting that the people on beta blockers um do show um almost no melatonin release but but the interesting studies and again you have to read the papers so there's a study showing quadriplegic individuals those people who tragically you know severed their spinal cord you know at the level

(53:09) of the neck have nothing you know below the neck um have terrible sleep um and that's the argument was originally well that's because they're not producing any pineal melatonin then you compare those individuals to paraplegics who of course can regulate their pineal melatonin production they also have terrible sleep and it's not different from the quadriplegics so it's it's the the the ghastliness of losing some you know of not being mobile that's the problem with this sleep not the lack

(53:41) of melatonin and in the best studies ever undertaken taking melatonin before you go to bed can reduce the time it takes to get to sleep by 30 minutes and I stress that's the best study ever undertaken many studies showed no effects whatsoever so let's study do you mean the most the most the most positive study exactly the most best conducted stuff exactly yeah the one the one that showed the most the greatest efficacy might be that yeah so it can be thought of as a mild modular you know you you also see people right oh well um light

(54:14) in the middle of the night um uh increases alertness because it's suppressing melatonin um well it does suppress melatonin but the alerting effect occurs before there's any decrease in melatonin so it it's an acute effect upon the brain not via melatonin so there's a there's a whole whole mass of of again nonsense out there about melatonin just on the Melatonin note because I have I I know a bunch of people who are super into the whole optimizing human body type stuff yeah who will sort of think are dabbling

(54:47) with like micro dosing melatonin or like taking melatonin when you're jet lagged what what does the research say on um for melatonin for jet lag in some individuals it can it can speed up a little bit to the rate at which you lock on to the new uh the new um time zone so Josephine Lawrence showed that those those findings a few years ago but it's a mild effect uh don't worry about taking melatonin I think not and in fact Pilots are warned not to uh because it might have a slight sleep inductive effect and even worse um if it does

(55:24) affect the clock you don't know where the clock is with multiple you know changes of time zones I I tried it a lot when I was flying to Australia and I found that in fact it it actually didn't help me at all and in fact it was quite weird because you're not recommended to take melatonin if you are uh vulnerable to depression or mental illness because it's quite similar to things like serotonin now I'm not luckily vulnerable to depression but but weirdly uh after taking melatonin and this is an N of one

(55:57) so you know it counts for nothing but I I found I I was not as robustly Jolly as I as I normally am uh so I I stopped using it and of course the thing to do in the new time zone if you're traveling west seek out light so you know London to New York get out in the afternoon in New York and and that will help you adjust when traveling uh East for more than three four time zones then avoid Morning Light uh and seek out afternoon light and that's because if you're still based on London time you see light in

(56:35) the new time zone when you're traveling East that would delay the clock shove you back towards Europe here rather than Advance the clock um and drag you forward to India or Australia we said Morning Light advances the clock yes and evening like delays the clock that's right but afternoon afternoon light of course when you're in Australia would be dusk in the UK which would delay the clock which is what you up oh okay so it's not the nature of the light it's the timing of the timing of the light yeah okay so what you need to

(57:10) do is you need to get um when you're in Australia you need to get light to advance the clock and so because you're dragging it forward in time and when you say Advance the clock that means you're going to sleep later it would no no Advanced account means you you go to bed earlier and get up earlier which is what's what's happening in Australia okay whereas of course if you get it at the wrong time you could you could delay the clock and and take you back to Europe I know it's complicated

(57:41) um and you have to think about it yeah but the key thing is uh work out when Dawn and dusk is in London let's say and knowing that dusk delays the clock and thus delays DND morning advances work out what it would be in Australia and then then uh exposure like MADD morning advances dust delays and by advancing the body clock that means we drag you forward to Australia in time it'll make you get up earlier because remember they're getting up earlier but they're getting up you know 12 hours earlier

(58:13) than we are yeah um and of course you know if you're going west to the States they're getting up behind us so you want to delay going west and Advance going east it's difficult to hold in one's mind yeah but but it'll click yeah oh God yeah that makes sense yeah so so how do you avoid Morning Light um when you first arrive in Australia um dark glasses yeah oh sunglasses sunglasses okay how much does that tend to reduce your Lux that will reduce it very significantly okay yeah I mean it's

(58:45) not perfect but I I mean you know you're in Australia so you're not going to hang out in the in the in the hotel yeah I'll be foolish okay I heard something around you should watch the sunset in the evening because that will like do something to your circadian rhythm what's what's going on there well again it's all part of that that dawn dusk exposure um and and it's uh it's getting that symmetrical exposure which is nudging the clock backwards and forwards and keeping it on cue and and of course when

(59:15) we're all agricultural workers that's what we got you know we're out of out at dawn and bed at dusk and that's why we were so beautifully aligned and you know that's what we've spent most of our evolutionary history but industrialization essentially has cut us off from natural light exposure yeah because I guess like in the in the winter there's not that many hours of daylight if you were to get Morning Light and evening light in the winter time would we end up sleeping for longer

(59:41) well or so what we know is that the extreme situation in Scandinavia if you go to Tromso where you don't get light for two months of the year and there's constant light of course is that um many families in Tromso they actually have a Lightroom um so they all the whole family bundles into this room with with um you know light boxes to get their morning light exposure to set the clock um it's also fascinating uh what um Arctic reindeer do um so so during the two months of darkness they turn off their circadian

(01:00:21) clocks so they're not showing any 24-hour patterns at all first of all there's no light dark cycle so there's you know kind of no point but also enjoying the winter uh the the drive is to feed as much as you possibly can whenever the weather conditions permit and of course in summer where there's constant light again there's no circadian change uh but the key thing during summer is you feed all the time because you've got to pack on enough calories to last the winter so that's a great example of where a clock actually

(01:00:56) isn't of any adaptive value So In Those Animals As arctic animals you turn it off now in humans we've only been in those environments for a few thousand years except for the native peoples in in Northern in the Arctic Circle we don't quite know what's going on with those individuals um but certainly uh in those arctic animals you have an Adaptive response where they turn their clocks off so in terms of sort of actionable things broadly sleeping or sleeping and waking up at the same time each day with a bit

(01:01:26) of leeway because it's a wobbly waistline rather than a regimented thing uh going for a walk in the morning is the first thing could you know very reasonable thing to do um getting some level of like natural light exposure in the evening as well yeah I mean I think that's right as long as it's symmetrical that's great I will end spy symmetrical you mean I mean I mean so that you're getting Dawn and dusk you're not just getting dusk which is what you know which would just delay the clock like as

(01:01:48) those University students yeah okay that makes a lot of sense what's the deal with um you should turn off you should dim the lights and stuff in the evening and you should put on candles in the evening and she won't do light blockers in the evening what's going on there so this is another another um issue I have and and so if you read the Press uh then looking at a Kindle before you go to bed uh is an absolute disaster because it'll it'll change your sleep wake timing um there are data that looked at this so

(01:02:19) the Harvard group got people to look at a Kindle on on its brightest intensity for four hours just before bedtime on five consecutive nights and it just statistically delayed sleep onset by 10 minutes oh perfect because I read Kindle before bed orange light setting but one of my colleagues said well it may be statistically significant but it's biologically meaningless right so going back to the you know our Point earlier which is you need a lot of light for a long duration to actually affect the clock um and so these devices the the Kindles

(01:02:56) are producing 30 Lux um now you can get an effect on the clock with 200 Lux or so but you need six and a half hours of exposure right so so again it's titrating intensity and duration yeah so there will be a slight wobble um but it's going to be very mild and of course if you're getting morning natural light it's going to correct any evening wobble um so for most devices the light is not the issue it's the alerting effect and where we have really nice data are for smartphones for example which have this

(01:03:35) incredible alerting effect not least in teenagers and that will uh increase levels of alertness and therefore delay sleep onto it lovely lovely anecdote I mean I remember speaking to um a young lad and I said um uh not smart you know to look at your your smartphone um before you go to bed he said look look you know it's okay with my computer I have my smartphone I've got a device uh which changes the color from Blue to to Red so it's just not a problem for me okay and I said okay well there's not

(01:04:10) really much evidence that there has much of an effect at all um and by the way what time are you getting to sleep you said well about 2 30 in the morning yeah and so you can actually fool yourself that you're protecting yourself with a with a screen that changes its color yeah and actually it's not having an effect at all other than you know it's on on the clock it's essentially this alerting effect that it does and many young people are aware that this is not a smart idea but the anxiety of being disconnected from

(01:04:42) social media and the friend circle is overwhelming and and so so it's it's you know our advice is always look you know try and be disciplined about it and I know how difficult it is we talked about Australia I those of you who remember black priests I I just got my Blackberry and you may remember we used to have one of those red lights that used to sort of glow when there was a message so I had my Australian emails um that was fine and then the European ones would come in um which of course would be bedtime and

(01:05:18) then the American ones will come in which of course will be even later and so I I know I'm weak like everybody else I had to leave my Blackberry uh in the lab because I would um uh I would you know because because I had jet lag I was a sleeping great you know and I'd sort of wake up and I'd see this glowing red light and I and and so I think you if it is a problem you had to do something about it which is detach yourself from it um yeah I found like the one of the biggest sort of tweaks I made to my

(01:05:48) sleep was just moving my phone charger across the room rather than on my bedside table so now the only thing I have on my bedside is a Kindle and a fan I think there's a strong argument for all of us not to use our phones as alarm clocks and go back to an old you know either digital um or you know mechanical you have to be slightly careful because some people clock watch which means you wake up as we've discussed and um and and of course normally most of us would fall back to sleep it's not a big deal but then you

(01:06:17) see the glowing dial on your on your bedside table uh I think oh my god I've only got two hours before the alarm goes off um and it then sends you into a state of anxiety which means you won't go back to sleep so for those individuals just cover up the the digital numbers because it's actually the important thing is when the alarm goes off not how long it is before the alarm guys off yeah I remember so this morning so I I have my alarm set for half seven but I woke up at like 6 50. and I was thinking Hmm I

(01:06:45) feel pretty alert right now but I know I'm gonna talk to you like I wonder if I should just and I went back to sleep and woke up that's it I was thinking about it for like 30 seconds it's a great example whereby one one just can chill and you can go back and you can get that you you know it's it's it's the terror of waking up again it's part of that sort of we're so frightened of the seat we're not getting that we then don't get it it's such a shame so is it better for you to wake up

(01:07:15) without needing an alarm or are alarms totally reasonable if you're waking up naturally without an alarm it's telling you you probably had a good night's sleep you also May wake up remembering your dream because of course we go through a series of stages which is the sort of the non-rem REM cycle REM standing for rapid eye movement sleep which is when the when you're essentially paralyzed from the neck down and your and your eyes if you've got a sleeping partner it's just it's sometimes fascinating to see you

(01:07:44) know the eyes wobbling behind the um the the eyelids if you don't have a sleeping partner then well you can sit in your dog or whatever um and it's just such an incredible state but it's during REM sleep that we have our most Vivid uh uh dreams and we wait naturally from REM sleep so those individuals who are waking up in the morning naturally are much more likely to remember their their dreams and while we're talking about dreams um I think it's really important to stress uh there's nothing to worry about with

(01:08:13) dreams dreams are a way of um the brain probably trying to make sense of uh our emotions and uh struggling with what we may or may not have experienced uh you know during the previous few days they do not anticipate things I mean mean it's there's no evidence for that whatsoever but they do seem to be associated with our emotional status so for example after the Twin Towers were destroyed uh there are lots of dreams not of seeing planes crash into the buildings which is interesting because that was the image that was constantly on the

(01:08:53) television but people had anxiety dreams of being mugged being overwhelmed by a tsunami so so so yes our dreams do reflect our emotional status but you shouldn't be worried about them because it's the brain trying to work through these issues um just on the point of the whole uh blue light yellow light thing yeah you know every device these days seems to have a nighttime setting where they'll suddenly go orange and yes I guess that lulls us into a full sense of security oh it's not too bad using my

(01:09:24) computer at like midnight because it's it's orange I think that's the thing yes um there's very little evidence that that shift in wavelength color will have any effect upon the clock um color is only important um when under certain circumstances um if if the light is bright it doesn't really matter what the color is um and we can talk about blue glasses in a moment uh so yeah I think it does listen to a false sense of security and you just need to stop using uh these these devices uh it it could well have a

(01:09:56) mild effect because after all these cells are maximally sensitive to the blue part of the spectrum but you're so low that it probably just doesn't matter much as more about the alerting it's yeah exactly it's it's the alerting effect um of of the content that you're processing and uh and it may well be some contribution of the alerting effect of light it looks as though the the threshold for regulation of the clock is higher you need more light to regulate the clock than you would to have an

(01:10:27) alerting effect ironically what's the last thing that most of us do which is stand in the most brightly lit room in the house the bathroom you're looking into an illuminated mirror while we clean our teeth and I've I've often thought there's a commercial opportunity to have a bathroom mirror with a bright Morning Light setting to increase alertness as before we leave the leave the house and slightly dim it to reduce alertness before um before we go to bed yeah yes and in the place I'm in at the moment there's a

(01:10:57) dimmer switch in the bathroom that's so good like as soon as it's night time I'm just like them all the way down and then let's feel like yeah um so presumably a light like this on full blast would probably not be advisable but even then I guess yeah yeah I mean I think I think that said it's it's it's it's not gonna have too much effect on the clock but but it but it will have levels of alertness and and we go back to you know one of the questions you asked earlier which is you

(01:11:21) know how much light what's the color um uh how long and for humans we just don't really have those data to design proper human-centric lighting for our indoor spaces it's a huge um area of interest at the moment um so uh yeah it's It's Tricky we need more research and you know and it's not as though we couldn't do it we can measure the spectral composition from small devices we can measure the intensity and what I'd love to do is is get a whole bunch of people um and measure their light exposure

(01:11:53) wavelength intensity throughout the day their levels of alertness with a simple sort of a response on a smartphone uh their sleep wake timing you could collect all this data cross correlate and then actually get some good Baseline data for human-centric lighting worth bearing in mind of course that the most important light is at dawn and dusk so what we do in the middle of the day may not matter that much that's the prediction but we don't have the data so we were talking a little bit about yeah about like the blue light stuff

(01:12:25) presumably then blue like glasses are a bit of a myth yes and in fact uh if you think about what blue light glasses do they will transmit blue and block out all the other wavelengths but um transmit blue so a filter works because it transmits one particular wavelength okay it passes through the glass yeah and blocks others right so it's not increasing the amount of blue light it's exactly the same it's just you know filtering blue light so if people use blue glasses to enhance their alertness right then yeah exactly

(01:13:00) there's no more blue light it's just blue light blocking glasses blocking glasses because they're just getting rid of the blue they're just getting rid of the blue and do blue blocking uh lenses work well they probably have some effect upon alertness um they may have some effect on Shifting the clock but it's going to be very mild if the light is bright enough it doesn't matter what the color is so if you're outside you're going to be exposed to so much light um you know in the thousands hundreds to

(01:13:30) thousands of Lux range that will shift the clock and in fact there was a consensus statement just produced recently from I think australasian uh ophthalmologists which suggested that blue blocking and uh and blue enhancing glasses had no effect at all and they were not they were not recommended I mean we did some work on um cataract surgery so um if you have a cataract and incidentally there's an interesting observation here which you might find amusing why is it that perfectly respectable elderly ladies have a blue

(01:14:09) rinse they have their hair dyed blue oh do they they're in the in the olden days um and it's and still to some extent and that's because they don't want their hair to look yellow so what happens as you age is your lens yellows so white hair looks looks yellow white teeth with the ghetto yeah yes and and so therefore blue will make the their hair look white so that's an old historical reference but anyway so so we asked the question uh does do blue blocking versus UV blocking lenses make any difference to

(01:14:52) sleep wake regulation uh after cataract cataract surgery and now we've done calculations showing that most commercially available blue blocking lenses actually um transmit uh more blue light than a normal healthy lens so it's not going to scrub the Circadian system and that's exactly what we found we found no difference between UV blocking and blue blocking on seat rate timing in after cataract surgery people still use blue blocking in the clinic because there's some not great data suggesting that blue

(01:15:29) light might enhance age-related macular degeneration now this the evidence for that in a dish in vitro is reasonably good but in Vivo in humans the data are not good at all but I think that people are on the side of caution and will use a blue blocking uh lens uh under most circumstances so when I was getting these glasses from the eye people they were like well you could pay an extra 100 pounds and you can get blue light thing on them I was like why and they were like well if you work with a screen a lot it might be good for

(01:16:03) you I was like okay I mean I work with the screen a lot and now I have this sort of slightly yellow Hue in my glasses which I now kind of want to get rid of because it's actually just makes the World Slightly unpleasant yeah um why would you do it well quite but the optician chat up sold me on this 100 pound upgrade because apparently it's better quick better for you if you use a screen do you know what he's getting out there or is it yeah yeah it's part of this whole myth again right this is this

(01:16:24) is that you know blue blocking um I yell slightly yellow tinted is good um uh if you're looking at the screen but why um I mean you know you're gonna get much more Blue Light by walking outside um and I don't think we have any real evidence base for a lot of the stuff that's been being um pedaled at the moment now I'm very happy to change my mind and admit that you know with new data it may it may be important but we don't at the moment have the data um and it would be very valuable I think

(01:16:57) yeah for you when you go back to your optician to say oh point me to the paper yeah where this has been shown to be effective and I think everybody should be doing that I think I think we should be challenging you know all of this by saying oh I'm very happy to do it but you know just show me the paper and where it's statistically significant maybe I'm just becoming a bit grumpy as I get older all right time to get rid of these blue um one thing I've heard is that it is good for you if in the evening you like

(01:17:27) candles because like the low sort of getting light from a low area like a candle or a lamp the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells respond differently to light from above so turn off the ceiling lights and turn on the lamp lights um again I don't know what the evidence base for that is but of course light in addition to its alerting effect um and of course it's regulation of the clock will impinge Upon Our emotions but but depending on context you know um romantic candles uh and it could well be an association that we make with

(01:18:03) these different light sources rather than any direct physiological response I wouldn't say I suppose you could call it perhaps a placebo effect it's it's it's it's a a perceived impact but actually it may just be you know in the cortex rather than any yeah yeah it's like oh I'm just you know I'm lighting my candles with my wind down routine and actually you know we're joking but but actually developing a wind down routine at the end of the day is really important before you go to bed

(01:18:37) and if it's you know candles that that do it and and even sort of for some form of smell whether it be you know lavender or something else the evidence that that sort of um oils actually do have an effect above Placebo is not very good in fact it's negligible uh but if it works then I think that's that's fine it's it's like it's like any relaxation techniques I mean I have to say in the early days when people were sort of getting peddling um mindfulness I sort of put it in the box

(01:19:12) of Crystal waving um and that's you know kind of my grumpy sort of background as I you know really I want mechanisms I want physiology I want to understand how it actually works and then actually I got in I sort of studied it a bit and I realized essentially what mindfulness is is a brilliant way of finding relaxation techniques and relaxation techniques work um we don't understand necessarily the mechanisms but they do work and so at the end of the the day trying to get rid of the stresses um then I think relaxation techniques

(01:19:47) whatever they are can be extremely useful I mean in our house I banned the discussion of family finances you know and and it's a shame because it's often the only time of the day that you couples do have chance to talk about come sort of serious issues because you get up you rush off to work you know you then get your dinner and then you have that sort of period of relaxation but actually what you don't want to fill that time with is angst promoting discussions um and so I think trying to find a time

(01:20:16) um maybe at the weekend where you can have those discussions is so important but not immediately before you go to bed my wife still tries though oh yeah family finances um what's uh so you talk in in the book a little bit about stress and the effects of stress on yeah how does stress and body circadian rhythms and sleep and stuff interact I think this is such an important Point um most people don't have a sleep problem they have a sleep or anxiety problem and so you know the the the the worry that they have is preventing them

(01:20:49) getting this sleep that they they need um and I think while we're talking about it it's worth distinguishing between sleepiness and fatigue sleepiness is cured by the opportunity to sleep fatigue is you can be sleeping a lot longer but you're still feeling tired exhausted lacking energy during the day and so many people with covid for example had fatigue they had long periods of sleep but they were still feeling exhausted and Below par and what fatigue represents is an underlying health issue um which is different from sleepiness so

(01:21:32) if you you get persistent fatigue then there's a chance you have some underlying health issue which you need to get explored I I was chatting to to somebody in the states just recently and she was telling me that um she was feeling tired all the day she couldn't couldn't work um and then she'd go to bed and then she'd wake up in the night um and of course ideally you'd fall back to sleep but she was so uh alarmed at all the stuff she'd failed to do during the day she couldn't then get back to

(01:22:04) sleep and it transpired actually she had an immune problem which of course was leading to her fatigue and so so sorting out the immune issue which was causing the fatigue which then was causing the anxiety which is then stopping her sleep and so I think it's really important to try and dissect all of these things you know what's distress do it increases blood pressure it increases levels of alertness you know it pumps out the cortisone an adrenaline it makes us more alert and so if you are stressed it's

(01:22:35) going to be tricky to sleep and so that's why it's so important to make that Detachment at the end of the day from the things that have upset you you know mindfulness anything yoga whatever um and of course the problem during covid and since is that many people's bedrooms have become their places of work uh because the bedroom has where you can set up your office and that's of course there's they're made for many people be no other possibility but by combining your sleeping space with your

(01:23:09) workspace it means that your opportunity to sleep is going to be affected by oh um maybe I should just just check the email again you know before I go to sleep or whatever or if you wake up you know the Tendencies are just just check if those those emails came in from this from the states and it has such an allergic effect you won't go back to sleep so if you I do have to have your office in your bedroom you've got to be really disciplined turn everything off and make it a real pain to have to turn it on if you have to wake in the night

(01:23:39) yeah so I guess um do you know like what the data is around I mean I've heard that uh acute stress is kind of good for you but like chronic stress is like bad for you yeah I think that that's a really important point and I have likened stress to a bit bit like um the gears of a of an engine so uh acute stress is like first gear it gives you that wonderful acceleration you can get away and do your stuff but if you leave the engine in first gear chronic stress then you're going to destroy the engine and that's I think a

(01:24:08) very interesting analogy because yes stress and we give you know um stress a bad time but actually it's evolutionarily really important it gives us that massive acceleration to get out of problems if the fight will flight response but it's where we have to keep on turning that mechanism on to function and that's what tired people do a night shift worker their entire biology um is in the sleep mode it's really important to stress that night shift workers 97 of night shift workers do not adapt to the demands of working at night

(01:24:41) so they're working against an entire biology which is saying you should be asleep and the override for that of course is turning on the stress axis which of course has which explains why long-term night shift work is associated with such chronic health conditions coronary heart disease type 2 diabetes you know what are you doing when you when you turn the stress axis on you're throwing glucose into the circulation to try and burn it up because you're going to need it for running away or fighting now if you're

(01:25:13) not then it just you become glucose intolerant um so obesity same thing um higher rates of cancer in night shift workers because what happens one thing we know about high levels of of cortisol they'll suppress the immune system making you more vulnerable to not only infection but cancer so so yeah stress and sleep um and the need to activate the stress axis to override the need to sleep is such an important part of our 24 7 Society this might be a little bit outside of your field of expertise but I wonder if you ever thought on this um

(01:25:48) around around stress and kind of taking vacations where you switch off uh or switch off from work I guess and I guess I'm asking because in this you know when I was working as a doctor it was it was easy enough to switch off from work because being a complete Junior I have no responsibility for anything that happens when I'm not around so broadly it was good and that's like oh crap I've ever made a mistake um I thought the Consultants were a bit more on edge about this because they're responsible for patients overnight but

(01:26:15) now doing this YouTube podcast writing type stuff in a way my work is my life and it's so tightly integrated that when I take time off I'm still always doing some work related thing or another and people will say oh it's really important to fully switch off and I'd be like well I don't know like I kind of enjoy it but I don't know if I'm bullshitting myself yeah I'm kind of like you um I don't feel as though I completely switch off um I'm going to be taking a holiday later this week uh but what are my plans

(01:26:46) what do I want to do well I I want to kind of do a bit of reading um around my subject area uh and I find that relaxing I wouldn't do that immediately before going to bed having this wonderful new book on what I said read but it'll be during the day so I think again you do the stuff that relaxes you um and and of course it's going to be some people um Laguna Beach other people doing different things other people uh mixing up a a a a naughty cocktail yeah I know and and I think you know it's very much up to the individual

(01:27:22) um so Okay so we've talked a little bit about stress um what's uh how does how do you how does I guess exercise relate to our circadian rhythm yeah that's um interesting first thing is that part of the Sleep mechanism is a drop in core body temperature uh and individuals if if you block that drop in core body temperature it's more difficult to get to sleep um and it's only about a drop in of about a degree so if you exercise uh late fairly shortly before you go to bed you're going to increase core body

(01:27:57) temperature and it might be more difficult to get off to sleep um exercise uh depends on why you want to exercise if you want to burn calories then there's there's two two ideas that because night time we're in a different metabolic status so during night time um we are burning stored calories and we're mobilizing those calories to keep metabolism going throughout the sleeping stage during the day we're taking calories in and we're metabolizing those calories and and burning them up ideally

(01:28:33) so if you want to exercise before breakfast first thing in the morning you're still in the Sleep metabolic status so you're burning up um stored calories which for some people is what they want to do the trouble is our ability to exercise increases throughout the day so most track records swimming records other athletic performance is peaking in the late afternoon and early evening so you'll notice at the people at the Olympics know this so the finals are always late afternoon early evening because that's when individuals can

(01:29:11) exercise for longer with greater power yeah so if you want to um so if you're a more of an evening person as I am then I am likely to be well I will be able to exercise for longer and exert greater power um later in the day than first thing in the morning now if you're a morning person getting up and doing your exercise before breakfast that's great for those of us who would find that particularly difficult then I think uh late afternoon and early evening is is where you go yeah I try I tried so hard

(01:29:46) to be uh kind of wake up early in the morning go to the gym before going to work kind of guy but I would always find that it would just be such a chore and I would look forward to it and be like why am I doing this is the worst thing ever and now when I go to the gym at like 5 6 p.

(01:29:59) m I'm having a great time that's it I think that's it you find out really what works best for you and I I and you know it's it's it's interesting because it relates to eating um our our habits our eating habits have changed profoundly um with the Industrial Revolution uh during the 1100s or so the main meal of the day was breakfast during the Middle Ages 1100 to 1500 it shifted to noon and I mean 12 o'clock 11 12 o'clock and that's where the main meal of the day we think of all those Tudor Banquets you know with people

(01:30:34) throwing chicken legs all over the place um that was actually lunch time right not in the evening yeah but with uh the industrialization and that the workspace was was different from the living space and commutes and and all the rest of it our main meal of the day many of us will run out the door with breakfast maybe a tiny breakfast we probably don't have time for lunch so we may have a sandwich in front of the computer and then we'll get home after a long commute shove something in the microwave um and then we'll be massively calorie

(01:31:08) you know having a massive calorie load you know late in the day and what's been shown is that there's a circadian regulation of our metabolism so the same it was a wonderful study looking at um the same meal at 8am versus 8 pm and those individuals who are the same same people but when they had the meal at 8 pm circulating levels of glucose were 17 higher than the same meal at 8 AM and of course leading late in the day high levels of glucose uh greater risk of diabetes 2 obesity and all the rest of it so when you eat is really important

(01:31:46) and the data now are very very persuasive um so yeah well so my late night Five Guys is like worse than my mid-afternoon Five Guys absolutely okay yes yes when you're young you're burning it off and if you can you know much right it's when you when you get to my decrepit age that um you can't you really shouldn't and so so we as we as a family have shifted our our meal times and we try not to eat late because of the greater risks does that a sort of uh eating because some people say that oh you know don't

(01:32:19) eat anything four hours before bed or something like that is that does that help you go to sleep if you're not eating at that time or no I mean It's tricky because some people feel that they need to go to bed on a full stomach to sleep better and the and the and the science behind that I don't I don't know I don't know quite what's going on there uh but certainly some people talk about it um ideally you know all the data would now suggest that try and minimize your calorie intake uh I think before four

(01:32:46) hours or so before you go to bed because of the the metabolic side effects okay rather than because of the Sleep side effects yeah broadly okay awesome um you know we we talked a bit a little bit about body temperature um one of the things that um everyone started doing after Matthew Walker's book came out was sleeping at 19 degrees and turning the AC on to Max and getting these fancy mattresses that you cool your bed uh do you know what the data is on those things anecdotally I found it helpful to sleep in a very cold room but

(01:33:15) yeah yeah and as as do I anecdotally and and certainly um that dropping core body temperature prior to sleep is is important uh whether we need to sleep in you know a cold air-conditioned room I'm not sure there is evidence it's not huge but there is some evidence that those mattresses that take away heat from the body do improve sleep we can get you off to sleep so I think there's something emerging there and indeed I am working with a mattress company I'm advising them because I do think there's

(01:33:53) something there and they approach me and what was interesting about them is that they wanted to do the studies which will show this or not they wanted an Evidence base for saying that yes here's the evidence and it does make a difference and so that's why I was interested in in working with them and Advising them uh we talked a little bit and uh earlier about kind of morning person evening person and the idea of chronotype yes uh how does one figure out their chronotype it's not that difficult there are

(01:34:21) questionnaires um there's a there's a question in a lifetime which is a well-validated questionnaire and it basically asks you know your preferences to a whole bunch of things and uh I think it raises I think it's interesting if you know your chronotype because it might help you explain certain aspects of your behavior but but certainly I've also wanted to encourage employers to take chronotype into account so if you're on the night shift it would make an awful lot of sense if you had a later chronotype versus a

(01:34:55) morning chronotype and uh not that you would remove all the problems of of night shift work but if you could match your Workforce um and uh so for example I've urged Banks um to say right you know this is 24 7 business why don't you develop teams whereby they're the morning types the middle types and they're called Larks doves and and owls but there are a whole bunch of other animals that are being used as well for these classifications I like the old you know um Larks in doves and owls um and then you've got a team

(01:35:30) that can span uh the the 24 7 banking sector that that will make it easier I mean you know you put the the the the owls on the on the um American uh when that when the American banks are at their Peak and you know the the Larks will be when the Asian banks are at their Peak and I think that working together across chronotypes could be really valuable yeah because there's a lot of like moralizing about the whole wake up at 5am and you are better than the sort of person that wakes up at 11AM kind of thing oh God yeah it's just that

(01:36:02) whole machismo of you know and of course those of us that remember the 80s you know people would bounce and say oh I've done another all-nighter and you know people used to slap them on the back and that's just nonsense I mean would you want in the workplace people who were lacking in empathy overly impulsive and incapable of making um sensible decisions no I mean you know that's the consequence of not getting enough sleep and so uh yeah I think that I think those days hopefully mercifully are gone although uh I understand the

(01:36:32) banking Community there was a survey last year uh and some I think Young Bankers were saying we're going to resign if you put you know there's huge working hours you know completely stressed I think the majority were getting less than five hours sleep a night um which which maybe a fraction wouldn't you know could could cope on that generally but most would not and and of course do you really want the people looking after our pensions and our national economies you know overly impulsive and failing to make uh

(01:37:07) and making sensible decisions about the economy no um so I would you know in the same way that the medical profession has to some extent ignored the impact of night shift work I think that the financial sector is another sector that really needs to start to take it seriously I was gonna ask about like these little  sheets you've got in front of you oh yeah because it seems like you haven't really consulted them but I wonder what's what's on them so so if one was gonna structure you know what what could you do

(01:37:35) um to develop sort of an Optimum sleeping regime perfect yeah so then I think you can divide you can divide sort of the day into four sections I mean so so during the day um we've talked about light for most of us 90 of us it will be getting Morning Light to set the clock what about napping um so uh a 20-minute nap in the early afternoon has been shown to be effective so the occasional nap you know can can make you function better during the second half of the day and some uh companies you know offer a 20-minute nap

(01:38:11) longer than 20 minute nap you you can drop into a deeper level of sleep and then recovery from that the Sleep inertia that you experience can make you groggy and it can be counterproductive but a short nap can be effective and are we talking 20 minutes of actual sleeping or yeah I mean you you basically um will will set your timer for 20 minutes you know and if you're tired you need a nap you'll probably fall asleep for most of that there's a big problem though for teenagers so they for reasons we've

(01:38:39) discussed tend to have shortened sleep so they're they're going to sleep they're waking up chronically tired and when you talk to teachers you know there are kids falling asleep at their desk they then get home they then will sleep for two or three hours relatively close to bedtime that pushes back sleep pressure which means it's more difficult to get to sleep that night so you fall into a cycle of later delayed sleep um shortened sleep and then extended not naps but really sleeps during the day so

(01:39:13) you need to be careful you don't fall in into that cycle um so so napping can be useful occasionally you know that's fine exercise again we've touched on not too close to bedside but bedtime because of course it can raise quality temperature but the key thing is to exercise um concentrating food intake during the first and middle parts of the day why well of course if you having your calorie intake towards the end of the day you're much more likely to lay it down it's fat that you are more likely

(01:39:44) to have conditions like obstructive sleep apnea which can massively harm your sleep at night so you know that's one thing to be careful of uh avoid excessive consumption of caffeine so many of us will not drink coffee after two or three o'clock in the afternoon caffeine has a long Half-Life I mean for depending on who you are five to nine hours so you know a late afternoon cup of coffee can again delay sleep at that night um when you leave work when you stop work you've got to make time to step back and switch into

(01:40:23) another mode some sort of relaxation you mentioned going to the gym that's that's great it's doing something that is completely different from your your your work so that's sort of things you can think about during the day before bed reduce the light again we've touched on this it's not because it's going to have a big effect upon the clock light will have an alerting effect so minimize light exposure 30 minutes before you go to bed stop using electronic devices again same thing you need to be winding

(01:40:53) down I'd ideally avoid prescription sedatives it's really important to be aware that sleeping tablets are sedatives they do not provide a biological mimic for sleep you know basically they encourage a neurotransmitter which turns off all of those alerting neurotransmitters in the brain and it's been shown that it can reduce for example memory consolidation and can promote daytime sleepiness particularly in the elderly and sleeping tablets are really not recommended for things like dementia and stuff like that

(01:41:31) alcohol many people will have a have a have a sort of a cycle of excessive coffee during the day to keep myself awake and then sedate themselves without alcohol at night really bad idea alcohol is a again a sedative it can disrupt the natural pattern of REM non-rem sleep and it can again harm memory consolidation and the processing of of information again we've touched on this before you go to bed avoid discussing topics that have a stressful alerting effect upon you and then finally you know before bed

(01:42:08) it's wind down and whether it's reading that Kindle which works for you um whether it's listening to a piece of classical music whether it's listening to Radio 4 extra whatever it is you know what works for you so that's sort of during the day and before bed the bedroom itself it shouldn't be too warm again we've talked about this loss in core body temperature if the bedroom is too warm it's much more difficult to get off to sleep again ideally it should be quiet now that's tricky of course in many sort of

(01:42:40) apartments and flats people have used white noise or relaxing sounds such as whale song or the sea and again try it out it it may work dark if possible and particularly if you're getting a lot of Street lighting through you can get blackout curtains that can go behind your normal curtains as much as you possibly can remove TV computers all of those sorts of alerting effects from the bedroom space as as we've discussed really tricky because many bedrooms have become also offices so make it difficult to turn those

(01:43:17) devices on um don't clock watch again we've touched on this uh the illuminated dial on your clock can be used if you wake up and oh my god I've only got a few hours people have to get up doesn't matter so so cover it up and of course don't use your smartphone so maybe just go back to an old mechanical clock although I'm told that the tick tock now for some people drives them completely crazy um sleep apps don't take sleep app seriously again as we've discussed none of them are endorsed by the national sleep

(01:43:53) federations they can be deeply misleading and can actually make you more anxious about your sleep what they're useful for is telling you roughly when you went to sleep how many times you work in the night and when you work up that can be useful because if you want to change your sleep timing or your sleep duration then you can modify your behaviors and then have a accurate record of that with your app so in the same way if you want to lose weight you can change your eating Behavior you weigh yourself in the morning you see a change in weight

(01:44:27) and that reinforces your your change to eating Behavior but don't start getting obsessed about oh I had a good good night's sleep or I had lots of slow wave sleep they're just not accurate enough at the moment to give you that information then of course in bed again try to keep to a routine go to bed and get up at the same times ensure that the bed is comfortable and large enough I do feel that uh webritz are kind of cheap about our bedding um you know it's a third of our lives and yet we're very reluctant to

(01:44:59) spend on you know decent mattresses and pillows and of course it depends on who you are go try them out talk to friends family about that sort of thing but I do think it's important to to take it seriously and invest in good bedding keep bed sides lights low again you can read comfortably but you don't have to have them too bright so it'll have an alerting effect now some people sort of Define the sleeping space with relaxing oils such as lavender and that can be useful the evidence that it actually works is not

(01:45:34) great but what also people might do is if they're traveling a lot they may take um their partner's aftershave or or perfume and then Define the sleeping space uh you know for them in a foreign place which can can Aid sleep so that's that's that's funny earplugs now this is a really interesting area if your partner snores then earplugs is is one solution many people can't cope with earplugs and so I recommend if you can finding an alternative sleeping space now that idea for many particularly

(01:46:16) um sort of older couples is is the the the the sort of the signature of death for the relationship it absolutely isn't whether you sleep in the same bed or not it does not define the quality of your relationship and I would argue in fact if you're getting a better night's sleep in a room next door you'll be more empathetic you'll have more fun together um and and you'll be a better person you're a better person so so don't worry if you if you feel you need to sleep elsewhere that as I say doesn't Define

(01:46:47) your relationship what you do need to be very careful about is that your partner it doesn't have obstructive sleep apnea and that's where there's a cessation a stopping of breathing for a period of time and then they'll wake up with a gasp and so now that's really serious and basically what obstructive sleep apnea is is a collapse of the musculature of the throat which actually blocks the the breathe the breathing channels um which means you're depriving the brain of oxygen it detects it's not

(01:47:20) getting the oxygen it leaves needs and it so we'll then wake you up uh now but that great surge in blood pressure without waking up has been associated with uh damage to the small vasculature within the eye and the brain and of course those individuals of the structure of sleep apnea have higher rates of coronary heart disease and all the rest of it uh exactly causing correlation is unclear but you do need to get it looked at it's it's a serious issue um it's been estimated that a very large number of those individuals running up

(01:47:53) are driving our buses and trains have abstracted sleep apnea causing of course daytime sleepiness and all of the other health areas so so get that looked at and it can I mean CPAP which is this sort of forced air mask can take a little of time to get get used to but it works in over 90 percent of cases so it's it's fixable um and finally as we have discussed if you wake stay calm um it's not necessarily the end of sleep you just need to maybe if you're not falling back to sleep immediately go to

(01:48:27) another space and relax and then return to turn to the bed when you feel when you feel um able to sleep again and the key thing is there's lots of things that you can try sleep so many people think is sleep is what you get and we and it's not we can have a lot of control over our sleep if we're not anxious about it and as soon as you've found something that works for you stick to it defend your sleep love it firstly thank you so much this has been wonderful um I guess one thing I'd like to sort of uh end with is you

(01:48:59) know you're you've had a pretty illustrious career you're a professor now you teach all these students uh we have a lot of students and young people listening or watching to this uh to this podcast I guess what would be your top tips for if you were if you were able to have a platform to advise young people about anything or other for I guess succeeding in life staying happy healthy yeah I think it's very it's really important um that we get education about the importance of sleep and circadian

(01:49:27) rhythms embedded uh within our schools uh and and just making the point that uh if you don't get enough sleep then you're going to have a negative view of the world there's some really amazing studies showing that tired people um remember uh the negative experiences but forget the positive ones so you know it's difficult enough being young but as it is but but only remembering the ghastly stuff that's going on rather than the good stuff means your world view is completely changed knowing that

(01:50:03) not having enough sleep you know you're going to be more irritable you're going to be more anxious um that you'll have loss of empathy you'll show greater levels of frustration you'll show increased tendency to use stimulants and then sedatives you'll have decreased cognitive performance moments you know this is the time of one's life when you're packing in you know your educational opportunities and not embracing one's education because of lack of sleep is a terrible squandering

(01:50:31) of resources um you'd have poor memory and concentration without good sleep uh you'll have impaired decision-making capacity um and creativity so all the sorts of things that make us this extraordinary species you know humor the ability to to absorb and use information all of this is in it is is inhibited by sleep and you'll also show reduced social connectivity so so sleep is not an Indulgence it's not a luxury it's something that is 30 of our biology or more and needs to be embraced and it

(01:51:08) makes you a happier healthier Lovelier person and it means what you can do is I suppose embrace all of the opportunities that the world has to offer and not getting enough sleep sleep is kind of a terrible squandering of of opportunity fantastic Professor Foster thank you so much this has been wonderful where can people learn more about you if they would want to want to follow up more of your work oh well there's there's lifetime of course which I've just finished so uh um you know much of what we've discussed is is in lifetime uh and
